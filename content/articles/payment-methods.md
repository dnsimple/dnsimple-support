# Payment Methods

When you subscribe, you will be required to provide a credit or debit card.

All self-service plans, including our free Solo plan, require a credit or debit card and do not offer an alternative payment method. This card will be used to collect the payment for the subscription fees, which are charged to the card on file on a monthly basis, and any purchases you make.

These purchases may include:

- Domain registrations
- Domain renewals
- Domain transfers
- SSL certificates

We use a [PCI-compliant](https://stripe.com/guides/pci-compliance) billing provider to process and store all payment data.

## ACH or wire transfer

<info>
Only available for Enterprise clients.
</info>

[Enterprise](https://dnsimple.com/sales) customers can issue an ACH payment (for US domestic customers) or a wire transfer (for non-US customers) to pay their DNSimple balance. Once DNSimple receives the money, the account credit will be adjusted to reflect the payment received, and all charges will be deducted from it.

Enterprise plans are also required to have a credit or debit card on file as a backup payment method. If the account credit runs out, the card on file will be charged.

## Digital wallet

<info>
Only available for Enterprise clients.
</info>

Our [Enterprise plan](https://dnsimple.com/sales) customers can replenish a digital wallet for use on future purchases. We support ACH, wire transfer, and card payments to add funds to your digital wallet. You'll receive email notifications when you add funds to your digital wallet and when your funds are low.

<info>
Automatic wallet replenishment is not yet available. Adding funds to your wallet is done manually.
