# Restoring a Domain

To reactivate your domain that has entered the [redemption period](/articles/what-happens-when-domain-expires/#redemption-period), it has to be restored. After completion, your domain's registration will be extended by the minimum renewal period (usually 1 year).

<warning>
The registrar applies a mandatory restore fee.
The final price of the restore will be the <strong>restore fee plus the standard renewal fee</strong>.
