# Restoring a Domain

To reactivate your domain that has entered the [redemption period](/articles/what-happens-when-domain-expires/#redemption-period), it has to be restored. This process takes up to a day to complete. We will send updates to your [account email](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/changing-email/).

Upon completion, your domain's registration will be automatically extended by the registry's minimum renewal period (usually 1 year).

<warning>
The registrar applies a mandatory restore fee. The final price of the restore will be the restore fee plus the domain's renewal fee.
