# Expiring Domain Email Notifications

ICANN, the organization that oversees domain name registrations for most top-level domains, sends required notifications about domains registered with us that will expire soon. These notifications come directly from ICANN and will be sent to the [registrant email address](/articles/contact-management) for the domain.

You will receive an email similar to the following, up to three times:

![ICANN Domain Expiration Email](/files/icann-domain-expiration-email.png)

This email will be sent from the addresses `<donotreply@name-services.com>`.

If your [domain is set to auto-renew](/articles/domain-auto-renewal) you can safely disregard the notification.

## Disabling Expiration Notifications

At this time there is no way to disable these notifications.
