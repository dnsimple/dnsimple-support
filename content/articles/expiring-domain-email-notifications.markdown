# Expiring Domain Email Notifications

ICANN, the organization that oversees domain name registrations for most top-level domains, requires notifications to be sent about domains registered with us that will expire soon. These notifications come directly from our upstream partners and will be sent to the [registrant email address](/articles/contact-management) for the domain.

You may receive a emails similar to the following, up to three times for each expiring domain, even if domain auto-renewal is enabled:

![Domain Expiration Email #1](/files/domain-expiration-email-1.png)

![Domain Expiration Email #2](/files/domain-expiration-email-2.png)

This email will be sent from the addresses `<donotreply@name-services.com>` or `no-reply@domainrenewals.ispapi.net`.

If your [domain is set to auto-renew](/articles/domain-auto-renewal) you can safely disregard the notification.

## Disabling Expiration Notifications

At this time there is no way to disable these notifications.
