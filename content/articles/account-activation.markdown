# Account Activation

You must activate your DNSimple account to register or transfer domain names through DNSimple, or to provide DNS resolution.

Activation is easy and includes a free 30-day trial. You can cancel at any time during your 30-day trial without being charged. During the course of your trial, you're free to [change plans](/articles/changing-plans/) to try different features.

</div>

<note>
If you're resubscribing to DNSimple, you won't have a new 30-day trial period. Your credit card will be billed immediately.

Your account is now active. Any domains you update to use our [name servers](/articles/dnsimple-nameservers) will now resolve with the DNSimple system.
