# Account Activation

You must activate your DNSimple account to register or transfer domain names through DNSimple, or to provide DNS resolution.

Activation is easy and includes a free 30-day trial. You can cancel at any time during your 30-day trial without being charged. During the course of your trial, you're free to [change plans](/articles/changing-plans/) to try different features.
