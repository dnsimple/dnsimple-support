## Overview

Account seats for additional team members are only available on Teams or Enterprise plans. The Teams plan includes one seat at no additional cost, allowing you to have one member actively involved in domain management. Any seats beyond the initial one will incur extra costs. Enterprise plans have custom pricing and seat numbers. [See our pricing page for more details](https://dnsimple.com/pricing).

## Increasing the number of seats

To increase the number of seats, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your account settings.
1. Select the **Member and Seats** tab.
1. Click **Manage** within the **Seats** card.
1. Choose the desired number of new seats.
1. Click **Update seats** to save your changes.

## Decreasing the number of seats

To decrease the number of seats, follow these steps:

1. Access your account settings.
1. Select the **Member and Seats** tab.
1.  Click **Manage** within the **Seats** card.
1. Choose the new seat quantity.
1. If the new seat count is lower than your current member count, you'll need to remove excess members to match the new seat allocation. You'll also see a list of members, along with those who have been invited but haven't accepted the invitation.

Below is an example of decreasing seats when the number of account members exceeds the newly selected seat count:

## Automatic Seat Allocation with Single Sign-On (SSO) Providers:

If you've configured your account with single sign-on using [Google](/articles/google-identity-provider/) or [Okta](/articles/okta-identity-provider/), your seat count is managed based on your organization's configuration, and seat allocation becomes automatic.
