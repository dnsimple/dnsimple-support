This article explains the requirements and special procedures for .CA domain names.

## Registration requirements for new registrants
When you register a .CA domain as a new registrant, the domain registration is temporarily put on hold.

To complete the domain's registration, the registrant must agree to the registrant agreement. The instructions will be sent to the registrant's email address. The email's sender will be the domain registry itself and not from DNSimple. Make sure to check your spam if you haven't received it.

The email will contain the following:

* A link to the [CIRA registrant agreement](https://cira.ca/registrant-agreement)
* Your registrant contact ID

To agree to the registrant agreement, visit the CIRA registrant agreement link, enter your contact ID, and click I Agree. Once this is finished, your registration will be completed.

Failure to do this within five days will result in your domain being deleted. You can attempt to register the same domain name again through the same process.

If you register another .CA domain with the same registrant information, you won't need to repeat this process. Your domain will be registered in real time.
