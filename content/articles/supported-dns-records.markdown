The Domain Name System (DNS) is composed of several record types called resource records. DNSimple supports most common and traditional record types, as well some newer types introduced to provide innovative services like [DNS Certification Authority Authorization](/articles/caa-record).


## Supported Records

We support the following standard record types:

- [A](/articles/a-record)
- AAAA
- [CAA](/articles/caa-record) (see note below)
- [CNAME](/articles/cname-record)
- HINFO
- [MX](/articles/mx-record)
- NAPTR
- [NS](/articles/ns-record)
- PTR
- [SRV](/articles/srv-record)
- [SPF](/articles/spf-record)
- SSHFP
- TXT

We also created 3 proprietary record types:

- [ALIAS](/articles/alias-record)
- [URL](/articles/url-record)
- [POOL](/articles/pool-record)

We support additional record types used behind the scenes to provide various DNS features:

- We automatically create the [SOA](/articles/soa-record) record for you when you add a domain.
- We create `DS` and `DNSKEY` records when you [enable DNSSEC on a domain](/articles/dnssec)


## Limitations

<note>
CAA records are only supported on the DNSimple primary name servers (ns1.dnsimple.com through ns4.dnsimple.com and ns4.dnsimple-edge.org). We don't support transferring CAA records to secondary name servers.
