With DNSimple you can request an SSL certificate that you can install on [Microsoft IIS](http://www.iis.net/) on Windows to enable HTTPS for a site.

This article provides step-by-step instructions to obtain a new SSL certificate via DNSimple, download the `.PFX` bundle and install it on Microsoft Windows IIS.

<tip>
Before you start, please take a moment to review [information and prices](/articles/ssl-certificates) about our SSL certificates. Most common questions are answered in the [SSL certificates FAQ](/articles/faq-ssl-certificates).

## Obtain the SSL certificate

## Install the SSL certificate on IIS

Open the certificate page and click <label>Install the SSL Certificate</label>.

![Click the IIS section](/files/certificate-installer-iis.png)

On that page, click the IIS section and follow the directions presented to you.
