# Do you support Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) SSL certificates?

Yes. You **can purchase certificates with elliptic curve keys**. To purchase an ECC signed SSL certificate, submit a custom CSR request signed with an ECDSA private key. The curve function for the ECDSA key must be one of the following:

* prime256v1
* secp384r1
