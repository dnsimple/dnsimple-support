# 60-Day Lock After Change of Registrant

For all domains under registries contracted with ICANN, including all [gTLDs](/articles/what-is-tld/), [newGTLDs](/articles/what-is-tld/), and potentially some [ccTLDs](/articles/what-is-tld/), a new [ICANN policies went into effect December 1st, 2016](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/ownership-2013-05-03-en):

> After 1 December 2016, registrars must impose a lock that will prevent any transfer to another registrar for sixty (60) days following a change to a registrant's information. Registrars may (but are not required to) allow registrants to opt out of the 60-day lock prior to the change of registrant request.
>
> To transfer a domain name to another registrar and change the registrant's information, registrants may:
>
> - Request the transfer to another registrar before changing the registrant's information (to avoid the 60-day lock); or
> - Have the prior registrant opt-out the 60-day lock (if this option is offered by the registrar) before making any change to registrant information.
>
> Because policies may vary by registrar, please review a registrar's policy before making a change to registrant information or transferring to another registrar.

We don't support the ability to opt-out of the 60-day lock. We highly recommend that if you plan to transfer your domain, you wait to update the contact information until after it's transferred.
