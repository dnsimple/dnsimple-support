## Quick overview

Email forwarding is enabled and billed monthly on a per-domain basis. The number of forwarded messages and email forwards allowed per month is based on your plan. [See the differences between plans](https://dnsimple.com/pricing).

When you enable email forwarding, DNSimple automatically adds the necessary DNS records to support forwarding. You can then create email forwards to redirect emails from addresses at your domain to other email addresses.
