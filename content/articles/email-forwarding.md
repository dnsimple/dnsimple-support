## Quick overview

Email forwarding is enabled and billed monthly on a per-domain basis. The number of forwarded messages and email forwards allowed per month is based on your plan. [See the differences between plans](https://dnsimple.com/pricing).

When you enable email forwarding, DNSimple automatically adds the necessary DNS records to support forwarding. You can then create email forwards to redirect emails from addresses at your domain to other email addresses.

## Getting started

To get started with email forwarding:

1. Ensure you're subscribed to a plan that includes email forwarding.
2. Navigate to your domain's **Email Forwarding** tab.
3. Create your first email forward to enable the service.
