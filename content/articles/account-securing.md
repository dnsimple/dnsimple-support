Domains are some of the most important assets for any organization, business, or personal project. We do everything we can to keep your domains and information secure, but there are steps you can take to further secure your DNSimple account.

<alert>
If you've noticed fraudulent activity, or suspect someone has taken over your account, contact <a href="mailto:support@dnsimple.com">support@dnsimple.com</a>.

## Password recommendations
- Create a unique password that includes letters, numbers, and punctuation. You can also use special characters (e.g. !@#$%^&*), multiple words, or a passphrase. Do not reuse passwords from other services.
- Make sure your password is 16 characters or more. This makes it more challenging for bad actors to compromise your account.
- Never give your password to someone you don't know. This includes DNSimple support â€” we will never ask for your password for any reason.
- We strongly recommend using a password manager like 1Password to create and store unique passwords for every service you use.

## Account sharing
- Don't share your account login with others.
- If you're on the Teams or Enterprise plan, you can [add seats to your account](/articles/managing-seats/), and use [Domain Access Control](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/domain-access-control/) to allow other users to access your domains with fine-tuned permissions.
- Only add authorized contacts to your account.

## Authentication
- We strongly recommend enabling [multi-factor authentication (MFA)](/articles/multi-factor-authentication/) for an extra layer of security. MFA is available free for every subscription.
- [Enforce MFA](/articles/multi-factor-authentication-enforcement/) for every team member managing domains on your account.
- Download and secure your recovery codes.
- Users who don't enable MFA are required to change their password every three months to maintain security. The new password cannot match any of the last five passwords used.
