# Securing your DNSimple Account

Domains are some of the most important assets for any organization, business, or personal project. We do everything we can to keep your domains and information secure, but there are steps you can take to further secure your DNSimple account. 

<alert> 
If you've noticed fraudulent activity, or suspect someone has taken over your account, contact security@dnsimple.com.

## Password recommendations
- Use a password for your account that includes letters, numbers and punctuation. You can even use multiple words or made up phrases.
- Use a long password (16 characters or more).
- Never give your password to someone you don't know. This includes DNSimple support - we'll never ask for your password to help troubleshoot issues.
- Use a unique password. Don't reuse a password from another service.

## Account sharing 
- Don't share your account with others. You can [share the domain](/articles/sharing-domain) or [use the Teams feature](/articles/account-users) to allow other users to access your domains.

## Authentication 
- For an extra level of security, [enable multi-factor authentication](/articles/multi-factor-authentication).
