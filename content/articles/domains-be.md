This article explains the requirements and special procedures for .BE domain names.

## Changing the Contact for a .BE domain {#trade}

Changing the registrant requires payment of an additional fee as per registry rules. Please contact us at [support@dnsimple.com](mailto:support@dnsimple.com), or through the [contact page](https://dnsimple.com/contact) for further assistance.

## Transferring a .BE domain {#transferring}

Unlike standard gTLD domains, .BE has some unique transfer rules. Please read the information below.

### Authcode {#auth}

Like most TLDs, .BE requires an authorization code to transfer a domain or to change the contact. That auth code will be sent to the current registrant's e-mail address when you start the transfer process within the domain details page.

You can also request that an authorization code be sent via the [registry website](https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/manage-domain-name/change-registrar).

## DNSSEC

We do not support [DNSSEC](/articles/dnssec/) for .BE domain names at this time.
