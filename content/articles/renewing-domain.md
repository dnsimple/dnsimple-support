# Renewing a Domain

By default, newly registered domains are set to [auto-renew](/articles/domain-auto-renewal/). If auto-renewal is off, or you want to extend the duration of your domain registration, follow these steps:

## To renew a domain

1. Select the relevant account from the account switcher at the top-right corner of the screen or from your Dashboard.
2. Locate the relevant domain in your Domain Names list. Click the domain name to access the domain **overview** page.
3. On the left-hand side, make sure the **Registration** tab is selected.
4. Click **Renew now for [price]/year**

5. Choose the number of years for which you'd like to renew the domain, then click <label>Renew [domain name]</label>.

> [!INFO]
> The total renewal price will be held on your card immediately.
> Your card will be charged once the renewal completes.
> If the renewal fails, funds will be released.
