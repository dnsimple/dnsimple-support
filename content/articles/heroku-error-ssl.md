# Troubleshooting Heroku SSL errors

This article describes somes of the most common errors you may experience when installing a certificate on Heroku, along with the corresponding solutions.

## Invalid common name (*.heroku.com or *. herokuapp.com)

You pointed your domain to Heroku to use an SSL certificate but you are receiving an error such as _Troubleshooting Heroku SSL errors_, _Invalid common name_ or _The certificate for this website is invalid_.

This error occurs because you are pointing the DNS to the generic `herokuapp.com` Heroku endpoint. Instead you need to **use the SSL host name provided you by Heroku**. The hostname generally ends with:

- `herokudns.com` if you are using the [Heroku SSL](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ssl) feature
- `herokussl.com` if you are using the legacy [Heroku SSL Endpoint](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ssl-endpoint) feature

### Examples

Here's a few possible variants of the error message, depending on the browser you are currently using.

**Google Chrome**

> ### Your connection is not private
>
> Attackers might be trying to steal your information from www.alpha.com (for example, passwords, messages, or credit cards). `NET::ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID`
>
> This server could not prove that it is **www.alpha.com**; its security certificate is from **www.bravo.com**. This may be caused by a misconfiguration or an attacker intercepting your connection.

**Google Chrome**

> This is probably not the site you are looking for!
>
> You attempted to reach example.com, but instead you actually reached a server identifying itself as *.herokuapp.com. This may be caused by a misconfiguration on the server or by something more serious. An attacker on your network could be trying to get you to visit a fake (and potentially harmful) version of example.com.
