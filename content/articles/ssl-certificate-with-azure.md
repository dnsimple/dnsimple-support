With DNSimple you can request an SSL certificate that you can install on [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) to enable HTTPS on your Azure application. DNSimple also provides the [ALIAS feature](/articles/alias-record) that is necessary if you want to point your root domain to Azure.

This article provides step-by-step instructions to obtain a new SSL certificate via DNSimple, install it on Azure, and configure Azure to use the new SSL certificate with the appropriate domain.
