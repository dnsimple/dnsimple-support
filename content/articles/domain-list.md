Your DNSimple Domain List list of all of your domains in an account, whether they are registered with DNSimple or using our authoritative DNS services. A maximum of 50 domains will be shown your list at a time. You can use the pagination under the domain list to view next and previous pages, or jump to a specific page.

Use the "Add New" drop down to quickly register or transfer domains, add new DNS zones, including secondary and reverse zones (if included in your account's plan), and add other items like email forwards, contacts, certificates, and DNS templates.

In your domain list you will see each domain name, domain registration status, DNS zone status, certificates, and when the domain was last updated. Clicking on the domain name will take you to the domain's management page where you can manage the domain registration, DNS, certificates, and much more.
