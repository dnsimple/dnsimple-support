## 1. How to set up multi-factor authentication

To get started with your team's DNSimple account, you should first verify that you have multi-factor authentication (MFA) set up.

If you're an administrator for your team, we recommend enabling MFA enforcement to ensure every team member has MFA set up before they can work with your domains and DNS.

To set up MFA, follow [this guide](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/multi-factor-authentication/#enable).

To enforce MFA for your team, follow [these steps](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/multi-factor-authentication-enforcement/#enable).

## 2. How to verify domain access control

If you're a new member in an existing team account, and you don't have full access, an administrator may need to set up access to one or more domains in the account. Contact your administrator to ensure you have access to the correct domains.

If you're an administrator for an account, our Domain Access Control [support article](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/domain-access-control/) provides a video guide along with steps for how to set up user access and permissions.
