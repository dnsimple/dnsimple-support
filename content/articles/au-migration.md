# Migrating Your .AU Domains from Our Legacy Provider

This article contains important information that is only relevant to customers who own or manage .AU domains in DNSimple registered via our legacy provider. If you are affected, you will receive an email from us asking you to take action. We included a list of your impacted domains in the email notification, or you can [view](http://dnsimple.com/domain-migration-on-renewal) them in your account.

## Who’s impacted?
This migration affects customers who have .AU domains registered in their account that have not yet been migrated to our new registrar partner. **You have until March 30, 2025 to complete the migration.** If you do not take action before this date, you risk losing access to your domains. You can view your impacted domains in the email notification or [in your account](https://dnsimple.com/domain-migration-on-renewal).

## What’s changing and how it will impact your domains
As part of our efforts to enhance domain management services, we are transitioning all remaining .AU domains to a new registrar. 

### After March 30, 2025:
- Auto-renewals and manual renewals at the current registrar will be disabled.
- If the migration is not completed by this date, your domains will not renew, and you could lose access to them.

## What do you need to do?
To ensure a smooth migration and continued access to your domain(s), please follow these steps:

1. Confirm the migration: Reply to the migration notification email you received, or email **support@dnsimple.com** to confirm that you want to proceed with the migration of your .AU domain(s). 
    - After you contact us to confirm the migration, we will send the authorization code to the domain's registrant contact’s email address.
2. Forward the authorization code. 
    - Once you receive the code, forward the email containing the code to **registrar@dnsimple.com**, and let us know you have done so. This will allow us to initiate the transfer to the new registrar.
3. Approve the transfer:
    - After we initiate the transfer, you will receive an email at the same address to which the authorization code was sent, asking you to approve the transfer.
    - **Make sure you approve this request to complete the migration by clicking the link included in the email.** If you decline or do not explicitly approve the transfer, we will need to restart the process, and your domain could be at risk of expiring.

We will verify the receipt of the authorization code and notify you when the transfer has begun. The migration process takes up to 2 days after the transfer is approved. We will inform you once it is completed.
