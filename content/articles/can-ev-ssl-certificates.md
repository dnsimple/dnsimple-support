# Do you support Extended Validation (EV) SSL certificates?

You **cannot purchase EV certificates** through DNSimple. We will not be adding this certificate for purchase, because it cannot be fully automated.

In terms of technical security, we recommend issuing a DV (domain validated) certificate instead. These are less expensive than EV certificates and offer the same cryptographic level of security.
