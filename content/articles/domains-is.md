This article explains the requirements and special procedures for .IS domain names.

## Transferring a .IS domain to DNSimple {#transferring}

### Before you start

> [!WARNING]
> To avoid the possibility of downtime, point the name servers for the domain to DNSimple (or another provider) [before you begin the transfer](/articles/before-transferring-domain/). This prevents downtime and allows you to perform changes to the DNS records during the domain transfer.

##### 2. Providing DNSimple's contact handle

`.IS` domains do not use authorization codes (auth codes). Instead, the transfer process requires providing DNSimple's contact handle to your current registrar.

1. After you've started the transfer, contact your current registrar and provide them with DNSimple's `.IS` contact handle:

   **BDB2-IS**
