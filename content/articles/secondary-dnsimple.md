# Using DNSimple alongside other DNS providers

<warning>
  If you want to set up automatic zone transfers (AXFR) between DNSimple and another DNS service provider, head to the [Add a secondary DNS server to DNSimple](/articles/secondary-dns/) and [Add DNSimple as a secondary DNS server](/articles/secondary-dns-dnsimple-as-secondary/) articles.
</warning>

You can use our API or UI to have zone redundancy with other DNS providers. You're responsible for keeping the zones in sync between other DNS providers and DNSimple. There are several ways to do this:

- [Adding the records](/articles/record-editor/) manually through our UI.
- [Importing a zone file](/articles/zone-files/#importing-records-from-a-zone-file) from your primary provider.
- [Using our API](https://developer.dnsimple.com/v2).
- Use "infrastructure as code" tools such as [Terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/dnsimple/dnsimple/latest/docs), [OctoDNS](https://github.com/octodns/octodns), and [DNSControl](https://github.com/StackExchange/dnscontrol)

This diagram shows how zone changes are propagated to both DNS service providers:
