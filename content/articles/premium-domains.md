## What is a Premium Domain?

A premium domain is priced differently by a registrar, and is generally found in the new gTLDs space. They're typically more expensive than a normal domain, with prices going into the thousands of dollars in some cases. An example of a gTLD is `.love` or `.ninja`.

## What makes a Premium Domain valuable

Premium domains appeal to specific businesses or groups of people, providing them with useful, specific domain names for their activities. Other times they're just popular keywords or a very well known combination of a name and domain. Some registries or registrars also consider two or three letter domains to be more valuable, so those may have a higher price.

For example: Paris is known as the city of love. The domain created as a combination of these could be `paris.love` and would be an attractive name for marketing companies or businesses. The `.love` registry may impose a higher fee for this combination. The registrar may even make it more expensive than a typical `.love` domain registration.

## What about renewals?

Renewing a premium domain can vary in in cost. It could be the same as a typical renewal or as much as a new registration. The minimum pricing for this is determined by the registry.
