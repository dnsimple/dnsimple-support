# What is a TLD?

The term top-level domain, or TLD, refers to the first part of every domain name. For example, in the domain name `dnsimple.com` the TLD is `COM`.

There are currently over 1200 TLDs, but not all of them are open for registration. For more information about available and supported TLDs, check the [list of TLDs supported by DNSimple for registration and transfer](https://dnsimple.com/tlds). 

<tip>
Even if a TLD is not supported for registration or transfer, you can still [add the domain to your account](/articles/adding-domain/) to use DNSimple for the DNS hosting or other domain services such as [purchasing an SSL certificate](https://dnsimple.com/ssl-certificates).

TLDs are generally grouped into 3 different categories:

- gTLD (Generic Top-Level Domains): this is the most common and well known category, that include general-purpose extensions such as the [`.COM`](https://dnsimple.com/tlds/com-domains), [`.NET`](https://dnsimple.com/tlds/net-domains), [`.ORG`](https://dnsimple.com/tlds/org-domains), [`.INFO`](https://dnsimple.com/tlds/info-domains), and many others.

- ccTLD (Country-Code Top-Level Domains): this category includes all the extensions used or reserved for a country, sovereign state, or dependent territory identified with a country code. Notable examples are [`.US`](https://dnsimple.com/tlds/us-domains), [`.CA`](https://dnsimple.com/tlds/ca-domains), and [`.UK`](https://dnsimple.com/tlds/uk-domains).

  Some ccTLDs have become so famous that are sometimes being confused with gTLDs. This is, for instance, the case of the [`.IO`](https://dnsimple.com/tlds/io-domains) TLD very popular in the internet/tech industry, or the [`.CO`](https://dnsimple.com/tlds/co-domains) TLD that has been widely used as a replacement for `.COM`.
 
 - newGTLD (New Generic Top-Level Domains): this category includes [all the new domain names](https://newgtlds.icann.org/) that have been created after ICANN/IANA decided to open the application of new TLDs to the market.
 
   This category contains hundreds of domain names. Just to name a few: [`.SHOP`](https://dnsimple.com/tlds/shop-domains), [`.EMAIL`](https://dnsimple.com/tlds/email-domains), [`.XYZ`](https://dnsimple.com/tlds/xyz-domains), etc.
