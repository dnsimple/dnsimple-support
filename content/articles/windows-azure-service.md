[Windows Azure](https://www.windowsazure.com) is an open and flexible cloud platform that enables you to quickly build, deploy, and manage applications across a global network of Microsoft-managed datacenters.

## Enabling Windows Azure service

From the domain list, click on the domain name you want to update, then click on the DNS tab. Scroll down to locate the One Click Services section, and select "Manage services".
