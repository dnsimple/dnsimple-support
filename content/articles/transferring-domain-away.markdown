# Transferring a domain away from DNSimple

This article describes the procedure to transfer a domain registered with DNSimple to another registrar. The term *gaining registrar* refers to the registrar where you want to transfer the domain, the *losing registrar* is the current registrar for the domain, in this case DNSimple.


## Before starting

<warning>
Once a domain transfer is started, you won't be able to change the name servers on the domain. If you want to change your name servers, you can do so after requesting the code, but once you provide the transfer code to the gaining registrar you will no longer be able to make adjustments. 
</warning>

To transfer a domain to another registrar, the standard procedure requires you to:

1. Unlock the domain & request the transfer code from losing registrar
2. Start the transfer at the gaining registrar.
3. Approve the transfer request.


The first step is handled at DNSimple in one click. The other steps are the responsibility of the gaining registrar. We are unable to provide support for those steps.

The _transfer code_ (also called _authorization code_, _auth code_, or _auth info_) is required to authorize the transfer of a domain name. The use of a transfer code is a common procedure for most TLDs – including all the gTLDs, such as `.COM`, `.NET`, and `.ORG`.

Some TLDs have different transfer procedures:

## 1. Unlocking the domain and requesting a transfer code

You can prepare your domain for transfer out in one click. This action will unlock the domain and send you the transfer code via email.

The transfer code is sent to the email listed as registrant (owner) for the domain. Before proceeding, [check the domain contact and update the email](/articles/changing-domain-contact/#updating-a-domain-contact) if it doesn't match an email you have access to.

##### Preparing the domain for transfer out

1.  Log in to DNSimple with your user credentials.
1.  Search for and select your domain from the Dashboard
1.  Click Transfer Out from the Registration box once

    This will unlock the domain and email the transfer code to the domain registrant within 6 hours of requesting the code. Do not click more than once as it will slow down the delivery process. Please check your spam for the code as it will sometimes land in this folder..
</div>

If you have requested a domain transfer out and have not received a transfer code within the 6 hour period, please contact us and include your domain name in the email. We do not have access to see the code, for security purposes, and will not be able to expedite the code's delivery. If the allotted time has passed, you have verified the email address is correct and it is not in your spam, we will be happy to look into it and figure out why the transfer code has not arrived.

Note: Once this step is completed, so has DNSimple's role in the transfer process. All questions after this point need to be directed to the gaining registrar. 


## 2. Starting the transfer at the gaining registrar

Once you have the transfer code, you need to start the transfer at the gaining registrar. **Requesting the transfer code will not automatically initiate a transfer out.**

Follow the gaining registrar's instructions to start a transfer, and enter the transfer code when requested.

DNSimple does not have access to this process. Contact the gaining registrar if you need help with this step.


## 3. Approving the transfer request

Depending on the TLD, the gaining registrar, the losing registrar, or both may send you an email to confirm the transfer request. Verify that the information in the request is correct (especially the name of the gaining registrar), and confirm the request.

After the transfer at the new registrar is initiated, and the transfer code is provided, the transfer will be initiated at the Registry level. The registrar has 5 - 7 business days to release your domain(s). The transfer will automatically be approved at the end of this period. There's no way to speed up this process.

Once the transfer is approved, the domain(s) will now be with your new registrar and no longer with DNSimple.

Note: If you are transferring your domain out of DNSimple and no longer require any of our additional services, your account will remain active until you unsubscribe your account. This will not happen automatically.
