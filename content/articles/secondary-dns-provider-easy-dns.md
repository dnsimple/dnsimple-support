# Adding EasyDNS as a Secondary DNS Server

For an overview of secondary DNS, have a look at [our introduction article](/articles/secondary-dns).

**Requirements**

* An active account with **EasyDNS**. Every EasyDNS plan allows for secondary DNS Setup.
* Your domain [is pointing to the DNSimple name servers](/articles/pointing-domain-to-dnsimple).

You can get started with secondary DNS by clicking the **DNS** tab on the left side of the domain management page.

From DNSimple, select **EasyDNS** as the provider. Click **Enable** at the bottom of the form. The name servers and IP addresses that EasyDNS is expecting are already filled in for you.

A confirmation message will tell you that secondary DNS has been enabled from the DNSimple side.

Log in to your **EasyDNS** account. The first thing you'll do is add the domain.

<info>
EasyDNS has both a tabbed and one-page view. Your interface may look different depending on the layout you've selected, though the instructions below are the same.

Select the option **use an existing domain** for the domain.

Go through the payment process. All plans support secondary DNS. When you're finished, the domain is added and ready to be managed. Click on **manage**.

From the **DNS Settings** tab, you'll tell EasyDNS the primary name server. In this case, it's DNSimple. Click on **primary NS**.

Now add the DNSimple primary server IP address `18.189.127.127`, and confirm the changes.

<info>
  At the time of writing, **EasyDNS** only accepts IPv4 for secondary DNS

It can take up to one hour for the first zone transfer. To check if your secondary is configured correctly, select the **DNS Settings** tab, then click on **zone cache**. The link shows you what EasyDNS is currently storing in its cache for your zone. This should match your DNS records at DNSimple for all supported record types.

If everything is working correctly, you should see the DNSimple and EasyDNS nameservers.

Another way to verify your configuration is by using `dig` and querying the EasyDNS name servers. Read more about `dig` in [our overview article](/articles/how-dig/).

From your terminal, type the following `dig` command replacing `example.com` with your domain:

`$ dig @xfr0.easydns.com example.com soa`

The query should return all the DNSimple and EasyDNS name servers in the `AUTHORITY SECTION`.
