This article explains the requirements and special procedures for .CO.UK domain names.

For information about transfers and ownership changes that apply to all .UK domains (including .CO.UK), see the [.UK Domains](/articles/domains-uk/) article.

## Registering a .CO.UK domain {#registering}

.CO.UK is the most popular third-level domain under the .UK namespace. Registration is open to anyone worldwide, with no specific eligibility requirements.

## Transfer expiration extension

.CO.UK domains may or may not be extended when they are successfully transferred. If your .CO.UK domain has less than 3 months remaining before expiration, then it will be extended by 2 years. The price of this extension is included in the transfer fee. If your .CO.UK domain has 3 or more months remaining, then it will not be automatically extended.
