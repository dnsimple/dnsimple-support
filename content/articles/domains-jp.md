This article explains the requirements and special procedures for .JP domain names.


## Renewing a .JP domain {#renewing}

### Auto-renewal only {#auto-renewal-required}

This TLD doesn't support manual renewals. To successfully renew the domain, the [auto-renewal feature](/articles/domain-auto-renewal) must be enabled at least 1 month before the domain will expire, as explained in the ["auto-renew only" article](/articles/auto-renew-only-domains).

If auto-renewal is not enabled, the domain will be scheduled for removal **12 days before the expiration**. The registrar can deactivate it at any point during this period (even before the expiration date). It is possible to [restore](/articles/restoring-domain) the domain before final deletion, but the registry will charge a redemption fee.

## Transferring a .JP domain away from DNSimple {#transfer-away}

Transfers are NOT possible, if the domain is expiring within the next 30 days.
