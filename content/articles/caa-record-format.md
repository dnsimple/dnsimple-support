A [Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) record ](/articles/caa-record/)  is a DNS record used to specify which Certificate Authorities (CAs) are authorized to issue certificates for a domain. This document details the formal structure and the specific policy tags used within CAA records.

## CAA record format
All CAA records must adhere to a specific pattern in their RDATA (Resource Data) section:
`<flags>` `<tag>` `<value>`

| Element | Type | Description | Constraints |
|:--------|:-----|:----|:----|
| `flags` | Integer | An unsigned 8-bit integer that indicates special properties of the tag. | Currently, only `0` (no flags set) and `128` (critical flag) are defined. |
| `tag` | String | An ASCII string that defines the meaning of the value. | Must be an ASCII string. Defined tags include `issue`, `issuewild`, `issuemail`, and `iodef`. |
| `value` | String | The value associated with the tag. | The format and content depend on the specific tag used. |

## CAA record flags
The `flags` byte provides specific instructions for CAs processing the record:
- **`0` (no flags set)**: This is the default. CAs process the record as usual.
- **`128` (critical flag)**: If this flag is set for a tag that a CA does not understand or support, the CA **must** refuse to issue the certificate. This prevents CAs from ignoring policies they don't explicitly recognize.

## CAA record tags and their values
CAA records support several defined tags, each serving a specific purpose related to certificate issuance or reporting.

### `issue` tag: restricting general certificate issuance
Sets a policy for issuing **single-name and non-wildcard TLS/SSL certificates** for the specified domain or hostname.
- **Value**: A domain name representing the allowed Certificate Authority (CA).
    - **Examples**: `"letsencrypt.org"`, `"sectigo.com"`.
    - To disallow all CAs from issuing non-wildcard certificates, use a value of `";"` (a single semicolon).
- **Optional parameters**: The value can include additional parameters appended after a semicolon, such as `validationmethods=dns-01`.

### `issuewild` tag: restricting wildcard certificate issuance
Sets a policy specifically for issuing **wildcard certificates** (e.g., for `*.example.com`).
- **Value**: A domain name representing the allowed Certificate Authority (CA).
    - **Examples**: `"sectigo.com"`, `"digicert.com"`
    - To disallow all CAs from issuing wildcard certificates, use a value of `";"` (a single semicolon).
- **Interaction with `issue`**: When a certificate for a wildcard domain name is requested, an `issuewild` policy on the same name takes precedence over any `issue` policies.

### `issuemail` tag: restricting S/MIME certificate issuance
Sets a policy for issuing **S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) certificates**. S/MIME certificates are used for email encryption and digital signatures.
- **Value**: A domain name representing the allowed Certificate Authority (CA).
    - Example: `"digicert.com"`.
    - To disallow all CAs from issuing S/MIME certificates, use a value of `";"` (a single semicolon).

### `iodef` tag: requesting policy violation notifications
The `iodef` tag (Incident Object Description Exchange Format) allows domain owners to specify a method for CAs to report any policy violations (e.g., an unauthorized certificate request).
- **Value**: A URL for reporting. Typically an email address (prefixed with `mailto`:) or an HTTP/HTTPS callback URL.
    - **Example**: `"mailto:security@example.com"`
    - **Example**: `"https://iodef.example.com/report"`

## CAA record examples
Common CAA record configurations

<note>
A domain can have multiple CAA records to describe the desired set of restrictions.

| Scenario | Example DNSimple Configuration (Name / Flags / Tag / Content) | Canonical Form (for reference) | Description      |
|:--------|:-----|:----|:----|
| **Allow Let's Encrypt to issue** | `example.com / 0 / issue / "letsencrypt.org"` | `example.com. CAA 0 issue "letsencrypt.org"` | Only allows Let's Encrypt to issue single-name and non-wildcard certificates for `example.com` and its subdomains (unless overridden). |
| **Allow both Let's Encrypt and Sectigo** | `example.com / 0 / issue / "sectigo.com"<br>example.com / 0 / issue / "letsencrypt.org"` | `example.com. CAA 0 issue "sectigo.com"<br>example.com. CAA 0 issue "letsencrypt.org"` | Allows either Sectigo or Let's Encrypt to issue single-name and non-wildcard certificates. If any other CA attempts to issue, it should be denied. |
| **Specific Wildcard Authority** | `example.com / 0 / issue / "letsencrypt.org"<br>example.com / 0 / issuewild / "sectigo.com"` | `example.com. CAA 0 issue "letsencrypt.org"<br>example.com. CAA 0 issuewild "sectigo.com"` | Allows Let's Encrypt to issue single-name certs. Specifically allows Sectigo to issue wildcard certificates. For wildcard requests, `issuewild` overrides `issue`. |
| **Specific Validation Method for Let's Encrypt** | `example.com / 0 / issue / "letsencrypt.org;validationmethods=dns-01"` | `example.com. CAA 0 issue "letsencrypt.org;validationmethods=dns-01"` | Allows Let's Encrypt to issue single-name certificates for `example.com`, but only if the `dns-01` validation method is used. |
| **Request notification of violations by email** | `example.com / 0 / iodef / "mailto:security@example.com"` | `example.com. CAA 0 iodef "mailto:security@example.com"` | Requests CAs to send incident reports to the specified email address if they detect policy violations (e.g., an unauthorized certificate request). |
| **Disallow all domain name cert issuance** | `example.com / 0 / issue / ";"` | `example.com. CAA 0 issue ";"` | Explicitly prevents any Certificate Authority from issuing single-name or non-wildcard certificates for this domain or its subdomains. |
| **Disallow all S/MIME cert issuance** | `example.com / 0 / issuemail / ";"` | `example.com. CAA 0 issuemail ";"` | Explicitly prevents any Certificate Authority from issuing S/MIME certificates for this domain or its subdomains (as per RFC 9495). |
| **Disallow all certificate issuance** | `example.com / 0 / issue / ";"<br>example.com / 0 / issuewild / ";"<br>example.com / 0 / issuemail / ";"`| `example.com. CAA 0 issue ";"<br>example.com. CAA 0 issuewild ";"<br>example.com. CAA 0 issuemail ";"` |

## Quotes and special characters in CAA values
- Double quotes/backslashes: If your CA or provider gives you a CAA record value with double quotes around the entire string, or backslashes before semi-colons (e.g., `";"` or `k=rsa\;`), you can safely remove them when entering the value into DNSimple's content field. DNSimple's name servers handle these automatically.
- Other characters: Do not modify forward slashes or other unusual characters that are part of the legitimate value string (e.g., within a `validationmethods` parameter or an `iodef` URL).
