- A tax ID or company registration number if the organization is registered in Colombia
- Company registration details

### For individuals

Individuals can register .CO domains with standard contact information.

## Third-level .CO domains

DNSimple supports registration of the following third-level .CO domains:

- **.COM.CO** - Commercial organizations
- **.NET.CO** - Network infrastructure
- **.NOM.CO** - Personal/nom de plume domains

Each third-level domain may have specific eligibility requirements. For detailed information about a specific third-level domain, see the dedicated article for that domain.
