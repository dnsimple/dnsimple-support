Enterprise customers can manage multiple, separate DNSimple accounts under a single contract. This provides:

- Enhanced control and organization for businesses with multiple entities requiring independent domain and DNS management
- Improved account security
- Simplified billing across your various business units
- Administrators with access to all accounts within an Enterprise contract gain a centralized view of all associated accounts upon login.

## Managing accounts within your contract

The **Contract** card, which displays the list of associated accounts, is only visible to users who hold administrator privileges on all accounts within the Enterprise contract.

**To add or remove accounts from your Enterprise contract, please reach out directly to your DNSimple Account Manager.**

## Viewing accounts associated with your contract

To access the list of accounts linked to your Enterprise contract:

1.  Select the relevant account.
2.  Navigate to the **Account** page.
3.  Under the **General** tab on the left side, scroll down to the **Contract** card.

The **Contract** card provides a comprehensive overview of your multi-account setup that includes the following details for each associated account:

**Company Name:** The name associated with the specific account.
**Account Manager details:** Contact information for your DNSimple Account Manager.

**Account Summary:**

- **Account Name:** The individual name of the account.
- **Domain Names:** The total count of domains currently managed within that account.
- **Seats:** The number of users with access to that specific account.

**Contract Totals:**

- **Total Domain Names:** The number of domains across all accounts under the contract.
- **Total Seats:** The number of members across all accounts within the contract.
