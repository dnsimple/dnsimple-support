# Certificate Authorities used by DNSimple

We provide [SSL certificates](/articles/ssl-certificates) signed by different globally recognized [certificate authorities](/articles/what-is-certificate-authority):

- [Sectigo](https://sectigo.com/) (formerly Comodo) for wildcard and single-name SSL certificates
- [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) for single-name, wildcard, and multi-name (SAN) SSL certificates

We also used the following certificate authorities in the past:

- [RapidSSL](http://www.rapidssl.com/) for single-name SSL certificates (until September 11th, 2014)

You can find the Certificate Authority by inspecting the certificate information in a browser or checking your order in your DNSimple account.
