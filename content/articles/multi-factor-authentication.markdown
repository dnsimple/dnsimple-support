DNSimple supports [multi-factor authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication). We make this feature available for free to all user profiles, regardless of the subscription plan of any associated accounts.

Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) is a security measure that helps protect you from unwanted access to your account, and increases the security of your data. Once enabled, you're prompted to provide a verification code or use a security key in addition to your username and password when you log in. Verification codes should be generated by an authenticator app and will be refreshed every 30 seconds.

## Enabling multi-factor authentication {#enable}

DNSimple supports MFA using the following methods as a second verification step:
- Time-based one-time passwords
- WebAuthn-compatible security keys

You can enable MFA from your user page, either by linking a [one-time password authenticator application](#authenticator) or a [security key](#security-keys) that's compatible with [WebAuthn](https://webauthn.guide/) to your user profile.

Make sure to install a one-time password authenticator application if you'll be using one-time passwords for multi-factor authentication. You'll need it to generate a verification code to complete the setup. Or, if you'll be using a security key, have it ready to complete the security key registration.

When you enable MFA for your user profile, you'll be logged out of all currently logged-in devices.

##### To enable multi-factor authentication with one-time password

1.  Log in to DNSimple with your user credentials.
1.  Go to your [user page](https://dnsimple.com/user) by selecting the <label>User Settings</label> link under your user menu.

    ![Settings menu](/files/access-user-settings.jpg)

1.  Scroll down until you see the <label>2-Step Verification</label> section. Click on <label>Connect an authenticator app that generates verification codes</label>.

    ![Enable multi-factor authentication with one-time password](/files/user-mfa-enable-mfa-with-authenticator.png)

1.  Scan the barcode using a [one-time password authenticator app](#authenticator). You can also manually enter the secret code in your authenticator app.  Just click on <label>Can't scan the barcode</label>, and type the code into your authenticator.

    ![Multi-factor barcode](/files/user-mfa-barcode.png)

1.  Using the one-time password authenticator app, generate a verification code, enter the 6-digit verification code into the field, and press <label>Continue</label> to confirm. If the verification code is correct, you'll be redirected to the next step. Otherwise you'll be asked to enter a new verification code.

1.  The setup process ends here if you have an alternative MFA method already set up; however, if this is the only multi-factor authentication method you have set up, a [recovery code](#recovery-code) will be generated, and you'll need to confirm the recovery code. Copy and store the [recovery code](#recovery-code) in a safe place.

    ![Multi-factor recovery code](/files/user-mfa-authenticator-recovery-code.png)      

1.  Follow the instructions to complete the setup and activate multi-factor authentication via one-time password.

    ![Security key nickname](/files/user-mfa-enable-security-key-nickname.png)

    If this is the first multi-factor authentication method you're setting up, the screen will look slightly different, as-below, because a [recovery code](#recovery-code) will be generated, and you'll need to confirm it. Copy and store the [recovery code](#recovery-code) in a safe place.

    ![Security key nickname with recovery code](/files/user-mfa-enable-security-key-nickname-with-recovery-code.png)

1.  Click on the <label>Register Key</label> button â€” you'll see this if you have an alternative multi-factor authentication method already set up. You should see a prompt to choose the type of security key you want to activate. The prompt will look different depending on your platform and browser. Select the security key type and activate it. That will complete the security key setup process.

    However, if this is the only multi-factor authentication method you have set up, you'll see a <label>Continue</label> button instead of <label>Register Key</label>. Click on <label>Continue</label> to confirm the recovery code, then you can complete the security key setup process.


1.  Fill in the form with the recovery code, and click the <label>Confirm recovery and register key</label> button. You should see a prompt to choose the type of security key you want to activate. The prompt will look different depending on your platform and browser. Select the security key type and activate it.

## Logging in with multi-factor authentication {#login}
When multi-factor protection is enabled, you must perform a second verification step each time you log in with your username and password. The second verification step can be done with an authentication method you have enabled, like one-time passwords or security keys. 

<div class="section-steps" markdown="1">
##### Using a one-time password

1.  Log in to DNSimple with your username and password.

1.  If the credentials are correct, you'll see a 2-Step Verification window which may look different depending on whether you also have a security key enabled.

    If you also have a security key enabled as an MFA method, it will be the default authentication method displayed. Click <label>Use one-time password</label> to switch to using a one-time password for the second verification step.

    ![Multi-factor authentication](/files/mfa-login-use-one-time-password.png)

    If you don't have security keys enabled, you'll see the following 2-Step Verification window immediately:

    ![Multi-factor authentication](/files/mfa-login-authenticator.png)

1.  Use your one-time password authenticator app to generate a verification code, paste the verification code into the form, and submit to complete the 2-step login verification process.

<note>
The verification code automatically expires every 30 seconds. If the expiration is close to five seconds or less, you should wait for the next verification code to limit the possibility of an authentication failure.
</note>

## Recovery code {#recovery}

When you enable your first MFA method, a recovery code is created as a safeguard. Use the recovery code to disable MFA when you can't generate a one-time password with your authenticator app or activate your registered security key, or when you can't disable an MFA method. For example, because you lost the security key or the device where the authenticator was installed.

<warning>
The recovery code **is the only way to recover access to your account** if you can't generate a one-time password with an authenticator app or activate a security key for completing the 2-step verification process. Store the recovery code in a safe, secure place. **We cannot disable multi-factor authentication without this recovery code.**
</warning>

When you enter a valid recovery code, multi-factor protection will immediately be disabled. To keep your account protected, you'll need to enable it again by connecting a one-time password authenticator application or security key to your user profile. A new recovery code will be generated for you then.

<warning>
**All security keys and any one-time password-based MFA methods configured will be removed when you use your recovery code to disable MFA.**
</warning>

<div class="section-steps" markdown="1">
##### Disabling multi-factor authentication during login using the recovery code

1.  Log in to DNSimple with your user credentials.

1.  On the 2-Step Verification page, click <label>Use recovery code</label>.

## Multiple accounts

Multi-factor protection is attached to a user profile, not an account, just like your username and password credentials.

If [an account has multiple users](/articles/account-users), each member must enable MFA separately. If your user profile has access to more than one account, you only need to enable MFA once.


## One-time password authenticator applications {#authenticator}

DNSimple's one-time password-based MFA implementation is based on [RFC6238](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238), also known as time-based one-time password (TOTP). Any authenticator application compatible with this specification can be used to generate a DNSimple one-time password.

There are lots of time-based authenticator apps that generate one-time password verification codes. Here are some we recommend:

- [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447) for Android, Blackberry, and iOS devices
- [1password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword) for Mac, iOS devices, and Windows
- [Microsoft Authenticator](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/authenticator/e7994dbc-2336-4950-91ba-ca22d653759b) for Windows Phone


## Security keys {#security-keys}

DNSimple's security key-based MFA implementation is based on the [WebAuthn](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/) standard.

Both platform authenticators, e.g. [Touch ID](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mchl16fbf90a/mac), and cross-platform authenticators, e.g. [YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/products/), which are compatible with WebAuthn are supported.


## Best Practices for Multi-Factor Authentication

To benefit from true MFA, you must keep your one-time password authenticator application or security key, and your primary user credentials separate. For example, if you use your mobile device as your one-time password authenticator, you shouldn't have your primary user credentials on your mobile device.

If you decide to use your mobile device as both your security key or one-time password authenticator and device for accessing DNSimple, you still get the added benefit of a second verification step for log in should your credentials be compromised, but you won't benefit from true MFA. It's up to you to decide what level of security is important for you and your accounts.


## Troubleshooting multi-factor authentication {#troubleshooting}

#### Ensuring your phone's date and time synchronized

One-time password verification codes are based on time, so the time on your phone has to be in-sync with the official time. Otherwise, your authenticator app will generate a mismatching code. If your phone's time is out of sync, or if you've changed time zones, the best way to fix it is to change the time settings on your phone from "Manual" to "Automatic".

- [This article from Apple's help center will provide steps for iOS](https://support.apple.com/en-ie/HT203483).
- Changing this setting on Android may vary, but a [general guide can be found here](https://squareup.com/help/us/en/article/5288-update-date-time-on-your-device).
- You can also try the [Time Sync feature if you use Google Authenticator for Android](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/2653433).

#### Using a freshly-generated one-time password verification code

Sometimes, a one-time password verification code may not be accepted, despite entering it correctly. This usually happens when the original token was close to expiration.

The verification code automatically expires every 30 seconds. Most one-time password authenticator apps display a count-down with the remaining time before expiration.

![](/files/2fa-code-expiration.png)

If the expiration is close to five seconds or less, you should wait for the next verification code to limit the possibility of an authentication failure caused by time differences or connection latency.
