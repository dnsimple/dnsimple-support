# Can I upgrade a single-hostname SSL certificate to a wildcard SSL certificate?

No. It's currently not possible to upgrade a single-hostname SSL certificate to a wildcard certificate, even if they are issued by the same Certificate Authority.

However, if you decide a wildcard SSL certificate better fits your needs within 30 days of purchasing a single-hostname SSL certificate, we can refund your initial order so you are only charged for the wildcard.
