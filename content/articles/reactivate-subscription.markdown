# Reactivate your subscription

When you [unsubscribe](/articles/cancel-subscription), all your domains and records remain in your account. You can reactivate your subscription and start using DNSimple's services again at any time.

<note>
If you were subscribed to a [Legacy Plan](/articles/new-plans#legacy-plans), you'll have to choose one of our [current feature-based plans](/articles/new-plans/#newer-plans) during the reactivation process.
</note>

<warning>
If you subscribed to DNSimple in the past, you've already enjoyed our 1 month trial. **Reactivating your subscription will not grant you another 30 day trial**.
</warning>
