# Why should I register my domain name with DNSimple?

Domain registration with DNSimple is as easy as it gets. And there's no complicated pricing or convoluted contracts.  

We make domain registration effortless:

- Enter a name and verify it's available.
- Select a registrant from your contacts or add a new contact.
- For domains that require extended attributes (like `.CA` and `.US`), fill in the required fields.
- Register the domain.

We keep things straightforward. All domains registered with DNSimple automatically use DNSimple’s name servers and hosted DNS. And we'll never sell you anything you don't need.

We currently don't offer domain registration as a stand-alone service. Since [domain services](/articles/dnsimple-services) are our core business, DNSimple registration requires a subscription. DNSimple customers aren't required to use our domain registration services to take advantage of our hosted DNS.
