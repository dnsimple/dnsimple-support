[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud. 

If you use Heroku and have a DNSimple account, you can use our One-click [Services](/categories/services/) to set up the DNS records required by Heroku.


## Enabling Heroku service

1. From the domain list, click on the domain name you want to update.
2. Click the **DNS** tab on the left side. Scroll down to the **One-click services** card, and click **Add**.
