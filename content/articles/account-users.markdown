<info>
To add multiple users as members on one account, you must [be subscribed to an eligible plan](https://dnsimple.com/pricing).
</info>

A DNSimple account can be associated with one or more users. When you add someone to an account as a member, they will have full access rights to every resource attached to the account, including domains, contacts, SSL certificates, etc.

All members will also have full-admin access to the account, including the ability to access and change billing information and account details. The member will retain their unique login credentials and multi-factor authentication configuration.


## Adding members to an account

<div class="section-steps" markdown="1">
1. Once you've subscribed to an eligible plan, click the name of the account in the menu to visit the account page.

    ![Visit settings for selected account](/files/account-switcher.jpg)

1. From the main account settings screen, select the <label>Members</label> tab.

    ![Select the members tab](/files/add-member-account-link.png)

1. Click the <label>Invite</label> link.

    ![Add a new member](/files/add-member-link-members-screen.png)

1. Enter the email address of the user you want to invite. It doesn't matter if they have an account with DNSimple or not. They'll receive an email inviting them to join as a member of the account. If you're subscribed to an [eligible plan](/articles/domain-access-control), you can select the member's fine-grained permissions.

1. The invitation will appear in the pending invitation section until the user accepts it. If there's something wrong with the invite, you can resend it or remove it. Removing it will cancel the invitation immediately. They'll no longer be able to accept it.

</div>

<note>
It's not possible to add a user whose email address is the same as the account. You must first [change the account email address](/articles/changing-email#changing-the-account-email) (we recommend a generic email address such as `admin@` or `billing@`) before adding a user with the same email address.
</note>

## Removing members from an account

<div class="section-steps" markdown="1">
1. If you want to remove a member from your account, you should switch to the account, and visit the settings from the menu.

    ![Visit settings for selected account](/files/account-switcher.jpg)

1. From the main account settings screen, select the <label>Members</label> tab.

    ![Select the members tab](/files/add-member-account-link.png)

1. Click the <label>Remove</label> button for the member you want to remove from the account, and confirm that you want to remove them. 

1. Once you've removed them from the account, that user should no longer show up on the members tab.

</div>

## Managing member access

To share specific domains with each member, have a look at our [Domain Access Control](/articles/domain-access-control) feature.
