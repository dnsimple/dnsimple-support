# Suspended Account

In some cases, we may have to suspend your subscription. 

Common reasons include:

- Non-payment of subscription fee
- Chargebacks issued against your account
- Fraudulent activity
- Repeated failure to pay outstanding invoices
- Your account was identified as a root account causing service disruption for other customers

## What to do if your account is suspended

If you attempt to log in and receive an error message indicating your account is suspended, please contact us at [support@dnsimple.com](mailto:support@dnsimple.com), or through the [contact page](https://dnsimple.com/contact). We'll do everything we can to help you get your account back in working order.

If your email address is under a domain in the suspended account and is no longer working, please use an alternate email address to contact us. Include the email address for your account in the body of your support request. **We may ask you for additional information to verify your identity.**
