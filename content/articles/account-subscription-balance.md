# Account Balance

The account page has a full section dedicated to relevant information about your billing status. This information includes:

- **Next payment**
  When the next subscription fee will be charged to the credit card on file.

- **Amount due**
  The total amount of the subscription renewal.

  It's broken up into three different components that you may be charged for: _plan price_, active zones_ and _email forwards_.

- **Subscription balance**
  The current balance of your account. The amount can be:

  - Zero: Indicating that your account is up to date.
  - Balance due: Indicating that we didn't recieve or couldn't process the payment for your latest subscription renewal fee.

  Next to the balance, you'll find a estimated date for your next payment.

- **Account credit**
  If your account has credit, future payments may be deducted from this amount. Account credits fall into these two categories:

  - Credit for subscriptions: This credit is only used to cover subscription fees.
  - Credit for purchases: This credit is used when making purchases (register, renew and transfer domains, SSL certificates, etc.). We will also use this credit to cover your subscription fees before charging your card on file.
