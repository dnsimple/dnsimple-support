With DNSimple you can request an SSL certificate that you can install on [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) to enable HTTPS on your Heroku application. DNSimple also provides the [ALIAS feature](/articles/alias-record) that is necessary if you want to [point your root domain to Heroku](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/domain-apex-heroku/), as [explained](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ssl-endpoint#root-domain) in the official Heroku documentation.

This article provides step-by-step instructions to obtain a new SSL certificate via DNSimple, install it on Heroku, and configure Heroku to use the new SSL certificate with the appropriate domain.
