# Add DNSMadeEasy as a secondary DNS server

For an overview of SecondaryDNS, have a look at [our introduction article](/articles/secondary-dns).

**Requirements**

* An active account with **DNSMadeEasy**. Every DNSMadeEasy plan allows for secondary DNS Setup.
* Your domain [is pointing to the DNSimple name servers](/articles/pointing-domain-to-dnsimple).

You can get started with Secondary DNS from the DNS section of the domain management page.

![DNS management page](/files/setup-secondary-dns.png)

Select **DNSMadeEasy** as the provider. Click *Enable* at the bottom of the form. The name servers and IP addresses DNSMadeEasy is expecting are already filled in for you.

A confirmation message will tell you Secondary DNS has been enabled from the DNSimple side.

Log into your **DNSMadeEasy** account. The first thing you'll do is to create the IP set that enables zone communication between DNSimple and DNSMadeEasy. From the top navigation menu, select *Advanced*, then *Secondary IP Sets*.

<info>
  At the time of writing, **DNSMadeEasy** only accepts IPv4 for Secondary DNS
</info>

Add a new IPv4 set with the following values:

* Name: axfr.dnsimple.com
* IPs: 50.31.225.92

Now add the domain. From the top navigation menu, select *DNS* then *Secondary DNS*.

Click on *Add Secondary*.

In the popup, type your domain name, and select the IP set you just created.

If the configuration is correct, a success message will appear. You'll be taken to the detail page for your domain.

At the bottom of the screen, you might see an error message that the zone is out of sync. You may need to wait a few minutes for the zones to synchronize.

Refresh the page after a few minutes. If the configuration is working properly, you should see a section showing you the health of the secondary name servers.

Another way to verify your configuration is by using `dig` and querying one of the DNSMadeEasy name servers. Read more about `dig` in [our overview article](/articles/how-dig/).

From your terminal, type the following `dig` command, replacing `example.com` with your domain:

`$ dig @ns5.dnsmadeeasy.com example.com soa`

The query should return all the DNSimple and DNSMadeEasy name servers in the `AUTHORITY SECTION`.
