# Regional Records

<info>
This article describes a feature only available on the Teams plan and higher, where it's enabled by default. [See the differences between plans](/articles/dnsimple-plans/).
</info>

Regional records let you select geographical regions where you want a record to appear.

We have <%= POPS.count %> points of presence:

<% POPS.each do |server| %>* <%= server %>
<% end %>

When creating a new record, select the point of presence for this record. **If you don't select any, the record will appear in all of them.**

## Regional record usage note

Our regional records provide additional granularity for customers who want to tailor their DNS responses based on the DNS requests origination.

We have multiple Points of Presence (POPs). Some of these are geographically close, which can affect the routing path taken from Internet Service Providers (ISPs) used by the customers to our POPs. 

The Internet traffic routing is impacted by multiple factors, as the network operators routing preferences vary based on optimal routing selection, costs, and specific operator agreements.

In certain cases, network topology and geographical proximity do not align perfectly and can lead to unpredictable results with regard to where the network packets terminate.

When using regional records, bear in mind that defining a record for specific POP, without adding the same regional record for a geographically-close POP, can cause failing DNS resolution due to the above factors.
