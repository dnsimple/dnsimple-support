# Resending Domain Validation Email

Domain registries and organizations that oversee domain name registrations require validation of your registrant email address whenever a new domain is registered or your registrant email address or name is changed. This validation helps ensure the accuracy of contact information in the domain registration database and protects domain owners from unauthorized changes.

For most top-level domains, validation is required by [ICANN](https://www.icann.org/) (the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) as part of their [RDDS Accuracy program](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/rdds-2013-02-28-en). Failure to validate your registrant email address results in suspension of the domain name after 15 days of non-compliance.

## What the verification email looks like

The email is sent from one of the following addresses:

- noreply@emailverification.info
- DNSimple donotreply@name-services.com

The message will contain a verification link that goes to <https://www.emailverification.info/>.

## Resending verification email

If you are having trouble finding the email verification in your inbox, please remember to check your spam folder.

If it isn't there, resend the email by navigating to your domain page in DNSimple and locating the pending verification warning at the top of the page. Click **Send registrant verification email**.

Once the email is verified, the warning should disappear. If it doesn't, it may be because our system hasn't refreshed the latest status yet. Click **Refresh** to manually force a refresh.

## What happens if the registrant email address cannot receive email?

You must be able to receive an email at the registrant email address to complete the verification process. If you set up the email address after registration or changing your registrant details, contact support@dnsimple.com to resend the verification email. Be sure to include the domain name that you need to verify in your email to support.
