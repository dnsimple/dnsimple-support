# Querying MX Records

You can use [`dig`](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/what-is-dig/) to determine the [MX records](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/what-is-dig/) associated with a domain name. 

MX records specify the mail servers responsible for receiving email on behalf of the domain. The result is contained in the **ANSWER** section. 

It includes:

- The fully-qualified domain name (FQDN)
- The remaining [time-to-live (TTL)](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/what-is-ttl/)
- The priority
- The mail server hostname
