## Registration requirements for .ECO domains 

Anyone can register a .ECO domain, but it will not immediately resolve. To enable resolution, create a .ECO profile to activate your .ECO domain name with the .ECO registry. 

1. [Register](https://dnsimple.com/tlds/eco-domains) your .ECO domain.
1. An [invitation](https://support.go.eco/en/articles/702177-how-do-i-get-my-eco-profile-activation-email) to activate your .ECO profile will be sent to the registrant's email with the subject line **Activate [yourdomain].eco**. 
1. Follow the instructions in the email to create your .ECO profile at the [ECO Registry](https://profiles.eco/).
1. Enter the required .ECO profile [information](https://support.go.eco/en/articles/578589-what-questions-do-i-need-to-answer-in-my-eco-profile):
    - Domain owner and organization type (if applicable)
    - The areas of sustainability you're focused on 
    - Your location(s)
    - Take the .ECO pledge
1. Your .ECO profile is activated, and domain resolution is now enabled.
