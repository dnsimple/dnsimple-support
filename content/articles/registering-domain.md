# Registering a Domain

There are **two** reasons to register a domain with DNSimple:

- It's a newly purchased domain.
- To register a domain for which you're already managing the DNS.

We recommend [enabling auto-renew](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/domain-auto-renewal/#enabling-auto-renewal) whenever possible to avoid your domain expiring. Learn more about [what happens when a domain expires](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/what-happens-when-domain-expires/), and why you want to avoid it.
