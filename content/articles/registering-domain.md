# Registering a Domain

There are **two** reasons to register a domain with DNSimple: 

- It's a newly purchased domain. 
- To register a domain for which you're already managing the DNS.

We recommend [enabling auto-renew](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/domain-auto-renewal/#enabling-auto-renewal) whenever possible to avoid your domain expiring. Learn more about [what happens when a domain expires](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/what-happens-when-domain-expires/), and why you want to avoid it.

##### To register a domain

1. Choose the relevant account, and click the **Add new** menu on your Dashboard.
1. Click **Register domain**.
1. Choose an available domain name.
1. Click **Add new contact** to provide the registrant's contact details, or choose a contact from those you've already created.

If the domain was registered successfully, you'll be taken to a screen confirming your registration.
