## Transfers

### Required acknowledgment

All .US domain transfers into DNSimple require your explicit acknowledgment before they can be completed.

After initiating the transfer, you will receive the acknowledgement email within the same day. Once acknowledgment is completed, your transfer will take up to a week to complete. There are no further steps needed after acknowledging the transfer.

<warning>
All unacknowledged transfers will be canceled after 14 days.
</warning>

#### Acknowledgment process

##### Check your email
An acknowledgment email will be sent to the domain registrant's email address <strong>(this may be different from your DNSimple account email)</strong>. 

If you do not have access to the registrant's email address, we recommend updating this first via the domain's current registrar. Otherwise, your transfer won't succeed.

If you don't see the email, check your spam/junk folders.

##### Complete the process
Click the link provided in the acknowledgment email to confirm and complete your transfer.

If you don't receive the acknowledgement email, experience problems with the link, or need any help with your domain transfer, please [contact](https://dnsimple.com/contact) our support team.
