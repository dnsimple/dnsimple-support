# Linking and Unlinking Integrated Domain Providers

DNSimple supports the ability to manage domains that are registered with other domain providers external to DNSimple. DNSimple calls such providers "Integrated Domain Providers".

When you link an Integrated Domain Provider to your DNSimple account, domains registered via that Integrated Domain Provider will be imported into DNSimple and listed on the Domain Names page. You can view the expiry date, delegation name servers, domain registration contact, and DNSSEC information of your integrated domains from DNSimple.

## Supported Integrated Domain Providers

DNSimple supports domain integration with the providers listed below.
