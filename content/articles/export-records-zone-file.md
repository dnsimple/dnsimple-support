# Exporting records to a zone file

You can export your domain's records into a [zone file](/articles/what-is-zone-file/).

The resulting zone file will allow you to copy over all the domain's records to a third-party system. You can also keep the zone file as a backup of your domain's records.

Non-standard records, like [ALIAS](/articles/alias-record/) and [POOL](/articles/pool-record/), will be commented out in the resulting file.
