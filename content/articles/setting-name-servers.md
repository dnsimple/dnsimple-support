# Setting the Name Servers for a Domain Name

To set the name servers, your domain must be registered with DNSimple. If that's not the case, use the control panel of your current domain registrar to update the name servers.

You can set the name servers of a domain registered with DNSimple from your domain page.

## Pointing the name servers to another provider

Pointing the name servers to another provider will cause the domain to resolve using the DNS records configured at the other DNS provider. The DNS records in your DNSimple account will be ignored.

##### To point the name servers to another provider

1.  Instead of manually entering the name server names, you can also click <label>Add a name server set</label> to select a [name server set](/articles/name-server-sets/).

    If the name server has glue IP address(es) associated with it in the [name server set](/articles/name-server-sets/), and is a child zone of the domain which is having the delegation updated, glue records will be created for the domain at the registry. For instance, if `ns1.example.com` is being configured as a name server for the domain "example.com", and `ns1.example.com` has glue IP address(es) associated with it in the name server set it belongs to, the glue records needed to resolve `ns1.example.com` to its associated IP address(es) will be created at the registry.

1.  Click <label>Change Name Servers</label> to apply the name server changes.

</div>

<info>
DNSimple's listing of NS records for the domain will be updated to match the name server changes.

## Pointing the name servers to DNSimple

Pointing the name servers to DNSimple provider will cause the domain to resolve using the DNS records configured in your DNSimple account.

To change the name servers to DNSimple, follow the steps in [Delegating a Domain registered with DNSimple to DNSimple](/articles/delegating-dnsimple-registered/).

## Reserved name servers {#reserved-name-servers}

If you have [Secondary DNS](/articles/secondary-dns/) or [Vanity Name Servers](/articles/vanity-nameservers/) set up for your domain, the name servers belonging to the Secondary DNS or Vanity Name Servers configuration are considered "reserved", i.e. they cannot be edited or removed through the **Edit delegation** page.

![Reserved name servers](/files/reserved-name-servers.png)

To make changes to a reserved name server, click on the configuration icon next to it. You will be taken to the [Secondary DNS](/articles/secondary-dns/) or [Vanity Name Servers](/articles/vanity-nameservers/) configuration where you can make the necessary changes.

## Glue records

If you are adding a name server that is a child of the domain, glue records are required.
For more information on glue records and how they work, see our [What Are Glue Records?](/articles/what-are-glue-records/) article.
