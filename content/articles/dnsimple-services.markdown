# DNSimple Services

DNSimple provides essential services for every Internet-connected system: domain registration, hosted DNS, a powerful automation API, One-Click DNS services, and SSL certificates.

## DNS hosting

We bill DNS hosting as on top of your subscription base fee. Pricing is available on our [pricing page](https://dnsimple.com/pricing).

## Domain registration

We bill domain registrations and transfers on a yearly basis. Pricing varies depending on the domain name. For more information, view the [domain pricing list](https://dnsimple.com/tlds).

Want to use our DNS hosting, but not registration? You're welcome to use another registrar and change your name servers to our name servers. DNSimple customers aren't required to use our domain registration services to take advantage of our hosted DNS.

## Powerful automation API

With the DNSimple REST API, you can register domain names and administrate them directly from your own scripts. We have a [repository filled with API examples](https://github.com/dnsimple/dnsimple-api-examples), so you can get up and running. Some things you can do with our API include:

- Check domain availability.
- Register and renew domains.
- Transfer domains.
- Buy SSL certificates.
- List and Manage Records.
- Register to events using [webhooks](https://dnsimple.com/webhooks) to receive notification of changes.

## One Click DNS Services

One Click Services are ready-to-use DNS snippets. Applying a service creates all the DNS configurations necessary to configure your email and serve up your webpage.

We offer:

- Hosting services, like Surge, WordPress, Webflow, and more.
- Productivity services, including Google's G-Suite, Office 365, and KickoffLabs.
- Infrastructure services like Heroku.
- Email services, including Rackspace, Mailgun, and Fastmail.
- Ecommerce services, like Shopify and Squarespace.

## SSL Certificates

We provide three types of SSL Certificates:

- Single-host SSL certificates ($20 per year)
- Wildcard certificates (included in our higher tiered plans, or $100 per year)
- Let's Encrypt SSL certificates (included in the subscription)
