Creating a separate account is a flexible and secure way for agencies and freelancers to share domain management with their clients.

When you add your client as a user to an account, they will have full access rights on every resource attached to the account – including domains, contacts, SSL certificates, etc.

The client will also have full admin access to the account – including the ability to access and change billing information and account details. They will retain their login credentials and multi-factor authentication configuration.

<warning>
Each customer must have a separate account. If you add more than one customer to the same account, each customer will be able to manage other customers' domains.

## Creating a separate account for your client

You can add another account to your user profile by taking [these steps](/articles/account-multi/#creating-a-separate-account).

## Inviting your client to DNSimple

Verify your client has __registered__ with DNSimple.

If needed, [point your client to the signup page](https://dnsimple.com/signup). There, they can register using their email address, or via [Google as an identity provider](/articles/google-identity-provider).

<info>
Your client doesn't need to have an active subscription. They only need to be signed up for the service.
