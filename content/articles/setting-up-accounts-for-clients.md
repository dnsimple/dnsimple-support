Creating a separate account is a flexible and secure way for agencies and freelancers to share domain management with their clients.

When you add your client as a user to an account, they will have full access rights on every resource attached to the account – including domains, contacts, SSL certificates, etc.

The client will also have full admin access to the account – including the ability to access and change billing information and account details. They will retain their login credentials and multi-factor authentication configuration.

[Enterprise plan](https://dnsimple.com/enterprises) customers can take advantage of [multi-account management](/articles/account-multi-enterprise/). This allows you to manage multiple, separate DNSimple accounts under a single contract.

> [!WARNING]
> Each customer must have a separate account. If you add more than one customer to the same account, each customer will be able to manage other customers' domains.


## Creating a separate account for your client

You can add another account to your user profile by following [these steps](/articles/account-multi/#creating-a-separate-account).

## Inviting your client to DNSimple

Verify your client has __registered__ with DNSimple.

On [the signup page](https://dnsimple.com/signup), your client can register using their email address, or via [Google as an identity provider](/articles/google-identity-provider/).

> [!INFO]
> Your client does **not** need to have an active subscription with a credit card on file. They only need to be signed up for the service.

## Adding clients to the new account

Once you've subscribed the new account to an eligible plan, [add your client to the new account](/articles/managing-seats/).
