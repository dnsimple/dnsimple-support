## Password reset link email

If a user with that email address exists, then an email is sent to that address. The email contains a link that you must click on to enter a new password.

The email will arrive from support@dnsimple.com. In that email will be a link to https://dnsimple.com - either copy this link into your browser or click on the link if your email client automatically enables the link.

<warning>
Make sure that the link is to https://dnsimple.com/ - if the link is not to the dnsimple.com web site, do not use the link and contact customer support instead.
</warning>

## Enter a new password

Once you are on the DNSimple web site, enter a new password. Your new password will be recorded and you will be logged in.
