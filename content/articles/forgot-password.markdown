# Forgotten Password

## Get a reset password link via email

If you've forgotten your password, you'll need a password reset link to regain access to your account. Even if you initially [signed up via Google](/articles/google-identity-provider), you can still reset your password using this process. You can get a password resent link sent via email by going to the login screen and clicking the Forgot Password link.

## Password reset link email

If a user with that email address exists, an email is sent to that address. The email contains the link you must click to enter a new password.

The email will arrive from support@dnsimple.com. In that email will be a link to https://dnsimple.com - either copy this link into your browser, or click the link if your email client automatically enables it.

<warning>
Make sure the link is to https://dnsimple.com/. If the link is not to the dnsimple.com website, do not use the link. Contact [customer support]https://dnsimple.com/feedback)instead.

## Enter a new password
