# "Product Expiration" Notification

The **Product Expiration** email contains the list of products (purchased domains, certificates, and whois privacies) expiring within two months, grouped by expiration range.

Emails about expiring products will be sent to the account email address. Changes in certificate [validation emails](/articles/ssl-certificates-email-validation/) or domain [contact](/articles/contact-management/) information won't affect your expiration notification emails.

There are four expiration ranges: in a day, within a week, one month prior, and two months prior. These ranges cannot be customized.

The expiring product notification system is designed to reduce the number of emails we deliver to your inbox and make them more effective.

The notification is delivered as soon as one of your products enters the 60-day expiration period. We deliver, at most, one email each week with an overview of all your expiring products.

This email is part of the [expiring product notification feature](/articles/expiring-product-email-notifications).
