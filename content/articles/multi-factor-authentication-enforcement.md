[Multi-Factor Authentication](/articles/multi-factor-authentication/) (MFA) provides an extra level of security to protect your user credentials. You can enforce MFA for account members by enabling the feature on the account to ensure everyone on your team is using the best available security. 

When you have multiple users managing an account, it's vital to reduce the likelihood of a user's credentials being compromised. This feature is available on the Teams plan and higher, with the ability to [manage members of an account](/articles/account-users/).

## Enabling multi-factor authentication enforcement {#enable}

You can enable multi-factor authentication enforcement from your account members page.

You can only enable MFA enforcement on an account if all users have MFA enabled. If they don't enable it, you have to remove them from the team to enable this feature, then re-invite them. They'll be asked to enable MFA after they sign up so they can join your account.

## Disabling multi-factor authentication while in an enforced team

If you're part of a team that enforces MFA, you can still [disable multi-factor authentication](/articles/multi-factor-authentication/#disable) on your personal account.

<warning>
If you disable MFA, you will be removed from all accounts that enforce MFA.
</warning>


## Inviting new people into an MFA-enforced team

There are no restrictions on inviting new people to your account. When you invite users who don't already have DNSimple accounts, they'll be asked to enable MFA after they sign up so they can join your account.

If the user already has a DNSimple account, they can only join the team if they have MFA enabled.
