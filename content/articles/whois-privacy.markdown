The [WHOIS Privacy protection service](/articles/what-is-whois-privacy) keeps your contact information private for a domain. This service replaces the public information you provide with an anonymous proxy identity in the public WHOIS database.

You can purchase WHOIS Privacy protection for any of your domains any time, as long as the domain is registered with us and the TLD (Top Level Domain) supports the WHOIS Privacy service. You can check if a TLD supports WHOIS Privacy from the [list of supported TLDs](https://dnsimple.com/tlds).

<info>
For [new plans](/articles/new-plans), the price for the WHOIS Privacy service starts at **$3/year per domain**, and is based on the currently subscribed plan. For all [legacy plans](/articles/new-plans/#newer-plans-vs-legacy-plans), the price hasn't changed, and is $8/year per domain.

## Enabling WHOIS Privacy {#enable}

You can enable WHOIS Privacy protection from your domain page or the domain list.

When you enable the service for the first time, a service cost will be charged to your account. You can then enable and disable the service at any time, with no additional cost, for one year.

## WHOIS Privacy and GDPR {#gdpr}

For generic TLDs (gTLDs) like .com, .net, and .org, WHOIS privacy is not necessary at this time as it will be redacted through GDPR. This also applies to new TLDs (nTLDs) like .app, .dev, and others.

For country code TLDs (ccTLDs) you will need to look at the policies for the TLD to determine their stance on WHOIS data. With ccTLDs, please research any TLD you plan on using to determine their stance on WHOIS data, and apply WHOIS privacy when it is available, as you see fit.
