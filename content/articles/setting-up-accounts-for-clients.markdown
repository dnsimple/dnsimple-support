Creating a separate account is a flexible and secure way for agencies and freelancers to share domain management with their clients.

When you add your client as a user to an account, they will have full access rights on every resource attached to the account, including domains, contacts, SSL certificates, etc.

The member <--another example of the "member" sneaking in will also have full admin access to the account, including the ability to access and change billing information and account details. The user will retain their login credentials and 2-factor authentication configuration.
