# What is SuperLock?

SuperLock is a mechanism to prevent individual users from performing destructive operations on a domain - like transferring the domain out. Without SuperLock, any user of an account effectively has admin power on any resource in the account. They could independently start a transfer out or push the domain into any other DNSimple account. That means a compromised user account can damage any resource inside the account.

With SuperLock, you can protect any domain from unintentional transfers or moves to a different account.

## Enabling SuperLock

That's it. Transfers and pushes are blocked for this domain as long as SuperLock is enabled.

This feature is relevant to the security of the domain. We'll send an email about this activity to all users in the account.

## Disabling SuperLock

If you want to transfer a domain that has SuperLock enabled, you'll need to disable SuperLock before you can proceed.

To disable SuperLock, you'll need a quorum of 2 users in the account to proceed.
