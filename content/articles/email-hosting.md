# Email Hosting Support

We don't provide email hosting, as our primary focus is [domain management services](/articles/dnsimple-services).

If you want to transfer your domain, and your registrar currently provides your email, these are your options:

1. [Use email forwarding](/articles/email-forwarding) - We provide email forwarding at $2 per month, per domain. Message limits and maximum number of email forwards per domain are based on your plan type. With email forwarding, you can forward your email to another email account.
1. Switch to Google Apps for Business - Use our one-click template to set up the DNS for Google Apps and go through the Google Apps signup process.
1. Select another email provider, such as [FastMail](https://www.fastmail.com/).
