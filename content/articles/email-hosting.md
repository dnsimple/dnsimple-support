# Email Hosting Support

## Does DNSimple provide email hosting?

Our primary focus is domain management services, so we don't provide email hosting. We work to focus on your DNS and domain management and provide you with the best possible experience for those services.

## What is an email hosting service?

Email hosting services run servers that let you pay to rent space for your personal or business email (or offer free options â€” like you get with Gmail and Yahoo). They let you set up a custom email address for your TLD, e.g. hello@sendusmail.com, instead of having to use generic @gmail.com or @yahoo.com addresses. 

If you own your own business, it's a good idea to use a professional hosting service. Professional email hosting services manage incoming and outgoing emails on a shared or dedicated mail server. They're significantly different from free services in that they offer more storage, better spam filtration, and higher sending limits. 

## What are my options if I use DNSimple and need email hosting?

If you want to transfer your domain to DNSimple, but your registrar currently provides your email, you can:

- Use [email forwarding](/articles/email-forwarding/). We provide email forwarding at $2 per month, per domain. Message limits and maximum number of email forwards per domain are based on your plan type.
- Use our one-click template to set up the DNS for [Google Workspace](/articles/google-workspace-service/) and follow the signup process.
- Select another email provider, like FastMail or one of our other [One-click Services for email](/articles/services/#email).

## Have more questions?

If you want to learn more about setting up email forwarding or our One-click Services, [contact support](/articles/dnsimple-support/), and we'll be happy to help.
