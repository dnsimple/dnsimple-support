# Reactivate your subscription

When you unsubscribe, or your account was closed due to non-payment(/articles/account-suspended/), all of your domains and records remain in your account. You can reactivate your subscription, and start using DNSimple's services again at any time.

When your account is deactivated, WHOIS privacy (link) and auto-renew (link) are disabled. If you want to use these features, you'll need to manually re-activate them.

If your account was on one of our legacy plans, you will not be able to reactivate it on the same plan, and will need to choose one of our available plans (link).
