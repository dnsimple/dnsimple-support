# Reactivate Your Subscription

When you unsubscribe, or your account was [closed due to non-payment](/articles/account-suspended/), all of your domains and records remain in your account. You can reactivate your subscription and start using DNSimple's services again at any time.

When your account is deactivated, [WHOIS privacy](/articles/whois-privacy/), [domain auto-renewal](/articles/domain-auto-renewal/), and [email forwarding](/articles/email-forwarding/) are immediately disabled.

When you reactivate your account, all previous preferences will be reactivated, including WHOIS privacy, auto-renewal, and email forwarding.

<warning>
If you subscribed to DNSimple in the past, you've already enjoyed our 30-day trial. **Reactivating your subscription will not grant you another free trial**.
