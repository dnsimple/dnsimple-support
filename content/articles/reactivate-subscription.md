# Reactivate your subscription

When you [unsubscribe](/articles/cancel-subscription), all your domains and records remain in your account. You can reactivate your subscription and start using DNSimple's services again at any time.

<warning>
If you subscribed to DNSimple in the past, you've already enjoyed our 1 month trial. **Reactivating your subscription will not grant you another 30 day trial**.
