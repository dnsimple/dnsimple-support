# DNSimple Name Servers

For DNSimple to provide DNS for one of your domain names, you must change the name servers for your domain at your domain registrar.

The DNSimple name servers are:

- ns1.dnsimple.com
- ns2.dnsimple.com
- ns3.dnsimple.com
- ns4.dnsimple.com

If you registered your domain with DNSimple, your name servers will already be set to the DNSimple name servers. There's nothing else you need to do.

If you transferred your domain into DNSimple from another registrar, and you're ready for us to start providing your DNS, you need to change your name severs to DNSimple. To do this, go to your domain page, and click <label>Switch to DNSimple Name Servers</label>. 

<note>
We do not automatically change your name servers to ours during the transfer process.

If you need to provide the IP addresses to your current registrar, use the following:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>IPv4 Address</th>
<th>IPv6 Address</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ns1.dnsimple.com</td>
<td>162.159.24.4</td>
<td>2400:cb00:2049:1::a29f:1804</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ns2.dnsimple.com</td>
<td>162.159.25.4</td>
<td>2400:cb00:2049:1::a29f:1904</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ns3.dnsimple.com</td>
<td>162.159.26.4</td>
<td>2400:cb00:2049:1::a29f:1a04</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ns4.dnsimple.com</td>
<td>162.159.27.4</td>
<td>2400:cb00:2049:1::a29f:1b04</td>
</tr>
</table>
