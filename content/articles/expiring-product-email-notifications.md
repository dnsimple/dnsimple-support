# Expiring Product Email Notifications

DNSimple monitors the expiration date of your purchased domains and certificates. We'll send weekly email notifications to the account owner when these products are 60 days from expiration. 

There are two types of expiring domain notifications:

- [Product Expiration](/articles/product-expiration-notification) - An email reminder with a list of products expiring within 2 months. This is delivered every week if you have products expiring within 60 days.
- [Product Expiring Tomorrow](/articles/product-expiring-tomorrow-notification) - An email reminder that lists products expiring in under 24 hours. This is a final notice, delivered once the day before the expiration date.

[ICANN](https://www.icann.org/en/resources/registrars/consensus-policies/errp) and our upstream provider will also notify you about the status of your domain via email. All notifications will be sent to the listed domain owner. These notifications cannot be disabled.

## Disabling expiration notifications

We provide the ability to [disable expiration notifications on domains that are not set to auto-renew](/articles/disabling-expiration-notifications). At this time there is no way to disable other notifications.

## Changing the contact 

To change the email address that receives these notifications, follow the instructions in [changing the account email](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/changing-email/#changing-the-account-email).

## What to do if your domain expires

If you missed these notifications and your domain expires, you still have the opportunity to retain ownership. Follow the instructions in [What Happens when a Domain Expires?](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/what-happens-when-domain-expires/) to learn what to do if your domain is in a grace period or if it’s entered [redemption](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/restoring-domain/).

## Disabling expiration notifications

Account owners can [disable expiration notifications](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/disabling-expiration-notifications) from DNSimple on domains that are not set to auto-renew. Registered domain owners will still receive notifications from ICANN and our upstream provider. You cannot disable certificate expiration notifications.
