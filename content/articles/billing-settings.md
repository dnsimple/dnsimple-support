Custom billing email is only available on Teams plans or higher. [See the differences between plans](/articles/dnsimple-plans/).

Invoices will be sent to the email address that corresponds to the DNSimple account. If you have more than one account, all invoices will be sent to the same email address.

<info> 
If you're on a solo plan, you cannot change the billing email address. If you've set up a separate billing contact, they do not have authorized access to the account, and information cannot be shared with them if they contact us. All future invoices will display the information you provided.

## Changing the billing email

If you're on a Teams plan or higher, we can deliver your invoices to a different email address from the one you use to manage your domains. This is not available on Solo plans.
