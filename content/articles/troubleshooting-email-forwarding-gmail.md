# Troubleshooting Email Forwarding

Once email forwarding is configured for your domain you may wish to confirm it is working as expected by sending a test message.

## Email Forwarding and GMail

To properly test that email forwarding works with Gmail, please use an entirely separate account from the one that will receive forwarded messages.

<note>
#### Test emails not appearing in Gmail

Google silently ignores messages it determines were sent and received from the same account. This will occur even if the message is forwarded through another address.
