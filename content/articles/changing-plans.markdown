# Change Subscription Plan

As a DNSimple customer, you might require features that aren't available on your current plan. This article discusses how to switch to the most appropriate subscription to meet your current needs.

There are two different types of plan changes based on when they are billed.

## Pre-renewal change plans

These plan changes are billed immediately and update the [billing cycle](/articles/yearly-billing).

You will receive credit for all the unused time of your current subscription plan. This credit doesn't include extra items like email forwards or extra zones. These will be billed again as part of the plan change. Read more about [subscription proration](/articles/understanding-invoice).

## On-renewal change plans

These plan changes are billed at the end of your current billing cycle along with your subscription renewal.

You can cancel these plan changes in your account settings:
