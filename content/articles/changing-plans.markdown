# Change Subscription Plan

As a DNSimple customer, you might require features that aren't available on your current plan. This article discusses how to switch to the most appropriate subscription to meet your current needs.

There are two different kind of change plans based on how they are going to be billed.

## Pre-Renewal change plans

These plan changes are billed immediately and update the [billing cycle](/articles/yearly-billing).

In case there are remaining days in your current subscription plan, you will receive a prorated discount. This discount doesn't consider extras, like email forwards or extra zones, which you'll be billed for again as part of the plan change. Read more about [subscription proration](/articles/understanding-invoice).

## On-Renewal change plans

These kind of changes are billed without changing the billing cyle. They will be billed along with the renewal of the plan, adhering to the existing billing cycle.

You can cancel a scheduled plan change in your account settings:
