## Renewing a .CH domain {#renewing}

### Auto-renewal only {#auto-renewal-required}

This TLD doesn't support manual renewals. To successfully renew the domain, the [auto-renewal feature](/articles/domain-auto-renewal) must be enabled at least 1 month before the domain will expire, as explained in the ["auto-renew only" article](/articles/auto-renew-only-domains).

If auto-renewal is not enabled, the domain will be scheduled for removal immediately after the expiration. The registrar can decativate it at any point during this period. It might be possible to recover the domain before final deletion, but the registry will charge a redemption fee.
