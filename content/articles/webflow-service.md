[Webflow](http://www.webflow.com) is a responsive web design tool, CMS, and hosting platform. 

If you have accounts with DNSimple and Webflow, you can use DNSimple's [One-click services](/categories/services/) to set up the DNS records required by Webflow.

## Setting up at Webflow

Follow the steps to [add the domain in your Webflow site](https://university.webflow.com/lesson/connect-a-custom-domain). Make note of the `A` and `CNAME` record values. You'll need to provide them when activating the service.


## Enabling Webflow service

From the domain list, click on the domain name you want to update, then click the **DNS** tab on the left side. Scroll down to the **One-click services** card, and click **Add**.
