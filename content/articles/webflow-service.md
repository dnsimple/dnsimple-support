[Webflow](http://www.webflow.com) is a responsive web design tool, CMS, and hosting platform. 

If you have accounts with DNSimple and Webflow, you can use DNSimple's [One-click Services](/categories/services/) to set up the DNS records required by Webflow.

## Setting up at Webflow

Follow the steps to [connect a custom domain to your Webflow site](https://university.webflow.com/lesson/connect-a-custom-domain). 

Note the `A` and `CNAME` record values. You'll need to provide them when activating the service in DNSimple.

## Enabling Webflow service

1. From the domain list, click on the domain name you want to update.
2. Click the **DNS** tab on the left side.
3. Scroll down to the **One-click services** card, and click **Add**.
