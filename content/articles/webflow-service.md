[Webflow](http://www.webflow.com) is a responsive web design tool, CMS, and hosting platform. With DNSimple's one-click [DNS services](/categories/services/), you can set up the DNS records required by Webflow.


## Setting up at Webflow

Follow the steps to [add the domain in your Webflow site](https://university.webflow.com/lesson/connect-a-custom-domain). Make note of the `A` and `CNAME` record values. You'll need to provide them when activating the service.


## Enabling Webflow service

From the domain list, click on the domain name you want to update, then click on the DNS tab. Scroll down to locate the One Click Services section, and select "Manage services".
