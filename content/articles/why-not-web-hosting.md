# Why we don't offer web hosting services

Traditionally, DNS registrars offered domains bundled with a hosting solution as part of a basic package. This gave the user a few MegaBytes of disk space exposed by an HTTP server and accessible with a FTP client. The idea behind this was that the user could have their personal HTML static site bundled with the registrar's offerings. However, this can confuse people who don't deeply understand these technologies. 

We don't offer web hosting because:

- We focus on offering the best domain management platform by enabling our customers to set up and connect their domains to popular services that already exist, rather than trying to create our own top-to-bottom solution.
- The web is diverse and complex, and there are myriad technologies available for creating websites. These require several pieces of software to work: database servers, web servers, caching services, load balancers, etc. Websites have heavier hardware requirements than just a few Megabytes of hard disk.
- There are many useful websites for people who need personal sites.
- A hosting service would only cater to a tiny fraction of our users that still make HTML static websites.
