# Adding a Domain

When adding a domain to your account, you can choose to register a new domain, transfer an existing domain you own from another registrar, or just use our DNS service if you plan to keep your domain at your current registrar.

### Using DNSimple for only DNS services

If you're using the DNS services available at DNSimple, but keeping the domain at your current registrar, add the domain name, then import the applicable DNS records by using the [auto-import tool](/articles/auto-import-dns/).
