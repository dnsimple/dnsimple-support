Wildcard certificates allow you to secure an unlimited number of names belonging to a single subdomain level. Wildcard certificates can make certificate management easier in some cases. However, you should avoid them unless you have a specific need, such as multi-tenant applications.

Wildcard certificates are no different from single name certificates. They contain an `*` as the hostname.

```
    APEX (root) Domain
      _____|____
     /          \
   *.dnsimple.com
   |
wildcard
```

<warning>
When ordering a Let's Encrypt wildcard SSL certificate, the wildcard (*) will _only_ secure subdomains. A wildcard certificate cannot secure the root (such as example.com). If you want to secure both the root domain and subdomains with Let's Encrypt, you will need to [order an additional certificate](/articles/getting-started-ssl-certificates/).
</warning>

## Let's Encrypt or Standard

Both providers support wildcard certificates. Let's Encrypt certificates are free, but are only valid for a short period. Sectigo certificates are valid for much longer, but also come with a cost per wildcard certificate.

You can learn more about the differences between standard and Let's Encrypt certificates in the corresponding [article](/articles/standard-vs-letsencrypt/).

<info>
Let's Encrypt wildcard certificates are available only on the following [plans](https://dnsimple.com/pricing): Professional or Enterprise.

## Use * for a wildcard certificate

To include any subdomain in a certificate, you need to use an asterisk `*` as the subdomain.

### Let's Encrypt

To order a Let's Encrypt wildcard certificate, follow the instructions to [order a Let's Encrypt certificate](/articles/ordering-lets-encrypt-certificate/).

When the certificate form requests the _name_, use the `*` char to represent the subdomain level you want to request the certificate for.

For instance, to request a certificate for `*.example.com`, just enter `*`. To request a certificate for `*.app.example.com`, enter `*.app`.

<info>
If your plan supports multiple names (SAN), you can add more than one certificate name in the same certificate.
</info>


### Standard

To order a Sectigo wildcard certificate, follow the instructions to [order a Standard certificate](/articles/ordering-standard-certificate/).

When the certificate form requests the _common name_, use the `*` char to represent the subdomain level you want to request the certificate for.

For instance, to request a certificate for `*.example.com`, just enter `*`. To request a certificate for `*.app.example.com`, enter `*.app`.

<note>
Standard wildcard certificates support only one wildcard per certificate.
