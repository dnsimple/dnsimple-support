# What Is a Zone File?
A zone file is a plain text file that serves as the authoritative blueprint for your domain's entire Domain Name System (DNS) https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/what-is-dns/ configuration. It contains all the resource records (like A, CNAME, MX, TXT, NS, SOA, and others) that define how your domain and its subdomains behave on the internet.
These text files adhere to a standardized format, most commonly the BIND format (named after the Berkeley Internet Name Domain software, a widely used DNS implementation). This standardization ensures that zone files can be understood and processed by virtually any DNS server software worldwide.

## What is inside a zone file?
A zone file systematically lists every DNS record for a domain, providing comprehensive information necessary for name resolution. It typically includes:
- [**SOA (Start of Authority) record**]/articles/soa-record/: Provides administrative information about the zone itself, such as the primary name server, the domain administrator's email, and various timers for zone transfers and caching.
- [**NS (Name Server) records**](/articles/ns-record/): Specifies the authoritative name servers for the domain, delegating DNS control.
- **[A](/articles/a-record/) and [AAAA](/articles/aaaa-record/) records**: Map hostnames to IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, respectively.
- CNAME records /articles/cname-record/: Create aliases from one hostname to another.
- MX (Mail eXchange) records/articles/mx-record/: Direct email for the domain to specific mail servers.
- TXT (TeXT) records /articles/txt-record/: Used for various purposes like email authentication (SPF /articles/spf-record/, DKIM /articles/dkim-record/, DMARC /articles/dmarc-record/) and domain verification.

And other specialized record types /articles/supported-dns-records/ as needed.

## Key uses and benefits of zone files
Zone files, due to their comprehensive and standardized nature, are incredibly useful for several key DNS management tasks:
- **Domain migration:** If you need to move your domain's DNS management from one provider to another, a common and efficient method is to export your domain's zone file /articles/zone-files/#exporting-records-to-a-zone-file/ from your current provider and then import/articles/zone-files/#importing-records-from-a-zone-file/ it into the new one (like DNSimple). This allows for bulk transfer of all your records, saving significant time and reducing errors compared to recreating each record manually.
- **Backup and recovery:** Zone files serve as a complete, human-readable backup of your domain's DNS configuration. In case of accidental deletions or major configuration errors, having a zone file backup allows for swift restoration of your DNS settings.
- Advanced configuration: While most users manage their DNS through user-friendly interfaces (like DNSimple's dashboard), zone files offer a low-level, complete representation for advanced users or for debugging complex DNS setups.

## DNSimple and zone files
DNSimple supports importing and exporting zone files, making it straightforward to migrate your existing domains to our platform or to create comprehensive backups of your DNS records. While you interact with your records through our record editor /articles/record-editor/, our system manages the underlying zone file that defines your domain's authoritative DNS.
