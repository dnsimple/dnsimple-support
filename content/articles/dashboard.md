Your DNSimple Dashboard contains all of the important highlights for each of your DNSimple accounts in one place. Important messages appear at the top of your dashboard. Under these messages you'll find overview information about each account, including how many registered domains, DNS zones, SSL certificates, and contacts are in each account as well as what plan the account is on. Below your accounts you will find a list of the most recent events in your accounts, including domain events, account events, and much more.

Each account card includes an "Add" dropdown that you can use to quickly register or transfer domains into that account, add new DNS zones, including secondary and reverse zones (if included in your plan), and add other items like email forwards, contacts, certificates, and DNS templates.

Use the "Search by account name" search box to search through your accounts if you have a number of accounts. If you manage domains for your clients or customers, organizing domains by customer account can be a good way to keep domains organized.
