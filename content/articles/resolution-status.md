# Resolution Status

The resolution status shows the name servers currently configured at the registry. Name servers are responsible for answering DNS queries for your domain, and their status is important to your domain functioning properly.

## Domains registered with DNSimple

If you registered the domain with us, we'll set the name servers automatically to DNSimple.

If you updated the name servers to another provider, those will appear as well.

If you transferred the domain to us, we don't automatically switch your name servers, but you can [switch the name servers to DNSimple](/articles/delegating-dnsimple-registered/).

## Domains registered with another registrar

If the domain is registered with another registrar, and you're using DNSimple only for DNS hosting, we currently don't show the name servers for your domain. If you want to point the name servers to us, [follow these instructions](/articles/delegating-dnsimple-hosted).
