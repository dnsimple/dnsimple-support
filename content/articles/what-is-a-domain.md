# What Is a Domain?

A domain name is a human-readable address that identifies a website or online service on the internet. Instead of remembering numeric IP addresses like `192.0.2.1`, you can use a domain name like `example.com` to access websites and services.

## How do domain names work?

Domain names work by translating human-readable names into IP addresses that computers use to communicate. When you type a domain name into your web browser, the Domain Name System (DNS) looks up the corresponding IP address and directs your request to the correct server. This translation happens automatically and transparently, allowing you to access websites using memorable names instead of numeric addresses.

## Domain name structure

Domain names have a hierarchical structure. The top-level domain (TLD) is the part after the final dot, such as `.com`, `.org`, or `.net`. The second-level domain is the part you choose, such as `example` in `example.com`. Together, these form a complete domain name. You can also add subdomains before the main domain name, such as `www.example.com` or `mail.example.com`.

## Why are domains important?

Domain names serve several important functions. They provide a memorable way to access websites and services without needing to remember IP addresses. Domain names establish your online identity and brand presence. They enable email addresses associated with your domain. Domain names make it easier to change hosting providers or servers without affecting how users access your site, since you can point the domain to different IP addresses as needed.

## Domain registration vs. DNS hosting

It's important to understand the difference between domain registration and DNS hosting. Domain registration means you own the right to use a specific domain name for a period of time, typically one year at a time. DNS hosting refers to where your domain's DNS records are stored and managed. You can register a domain with one company and host your DNS with a different provider. This separation allows you to choose the best registrar for registration and the best DNS provider for hosting.

## Domain ownership

When you register a domain, you become the registrant and have the right to use that domain name for the registration period. Domain registration is typically renewed annually, though you can register domains for multiple years in advance. If you don't renew a domain before it expires, you may lose the right to use it, and it may become available for others to register.
