[SupaDupa](http://supadupa.me) helps you set up your own professional online store without any of the skills or upfront commitments required when hiring a web agency to build one for you. With DNSimple's one-click [DNS services](/categories/services/), you can set up the DNS records required by SupaDupa.


## Enabling SupaDupa service

From the domain list, click on the domain name you want to update, then click on the DNS tab. Scroll down to locate the One Click Services section, and select "Manage services".

Now the service is added. You can remove it any time by following the steps in [how to remove a service](/articles/services/#removing-services).

Activating this service will configure DNS records where your main domain is your store. You must also [configure a URL redirect](/articles/redirector/) pointing `example.com` to `www.example.com` (replace `example.com` with your domain name).
