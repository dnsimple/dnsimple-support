# Registering a Domain

There are **two** reasons to register a domain with DNSimple: when it's a newly purchased domain, or to register a domain for which you're already managing the DNS.

When applicable, we recommend opting for our "auto-renew" feature to avoid your domain expiring if you plan to retain ownership.
