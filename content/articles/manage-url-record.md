    - **Name**: The subdomain you want to redirect, without the domain name. For example, if you want to redirect `www.example.com` enter `www`. Leave it blank to redirect the root domain `example.com`.
    - **Content**: The redirect target URL. It must be a URL (e.g. `https://blog.example.com`). It can also contain a path, query and any other standard URL components (e.g. `http://blog.example.com/path/to/site?redir=1`).

    As with any other DNS record, you can configure:

    - **TTL**: The record [time-to-live](/articles/what-is-ttl/).
    - **Respond From Regions**: Configure [Regional Records](/articles/regional-records/) if desired.
    - **Notes**: Include a [record note](/articles/record-notes/) (optional).

    Once you're ready, click **Add Record** to confirm and create the record.

1.  The record is created and visible in the record list.
