You can manage [URL records](/articles/url-record/) in DNSimple using the [DNS record editor](/articles/record-editor/).

The instructions in this article assume you're familiar with the [URL record format](/articles/url-record#record-format) and usage.


## Adding a URL record

<div class="section-steps" markdown="1">
#### To add a URL record

1.  In the record editor, click <label>Add</label> and select <label>URL</label> to add a new URL record.

    - _Name_: the subdomain you want to redirect, without the domain name. For example, if you want to redirect `www.example.com` enter `www`. Leave it blank to redirect the root domain `example.com`.
    - _Content_: the redirect target URL. It must be a URL (e.g. `https://foo.bar.com`). It can also contain a path, query and any other standard URL components (e.g. `http://foo.bar.com/path/to/site?redir=1`).

    As with any other DNS record, you can configure:

    - _TTL_: the record time-to-live.
    - _Respond From Regions_: Configure [Regional Records](/articles/regional-records/) if desired.
    - _Notes_: Optionally include a [record note](/articles/record-notes/).

    Once you're ready, click <label>Add Record</label> to confirm and create the record.

1.  The record is created and visible in the record list.
