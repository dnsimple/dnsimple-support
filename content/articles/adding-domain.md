# Adding a Domain

When adding a domain to your account, you can register a new domain, transfer an existing domain you own from another registrar, or create a DNS zone to use our DNS service if you plan to keep your domain at your current registrar.

##### To add a domain

1.  If you have more than one account, select the relevant one.
1.  Click <label>Add</label> on the account card, and choose the option that fits your needs.

</div>

You'll then be prompted for the name of the domain you want to add to your account.

### Registering a new domain

After adding the domain name, you'll be prompted to fill in information about the contact, WHOIS Privacy, and domain auto-renewal.

Click **Register [domain name]** in the bottom right corner to register the domain.

### Transferring a domain into DNSimple

To complete the transfer process, enter the auth code for transfer, select a domain contact, opt into WHOIS Privacy, delegate NS if wanted, and agree to the payment.

If the transfer is successful, you'll see a **Pending** notification:

### Creating a DNS zone

If you're using the DNS services available at DNSimple, but keeping the domain at your current registrar, select **DNS zone** to add the domain name, then import the applicable DNS records with the [auto-import tool](/articles/auto-import-dns/).
