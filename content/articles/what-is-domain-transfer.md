# What Is Domain Transfer?

Domain transfer is the process of moving a domain name registration from one registrar to another. When you transfer a domain, you are changing which registrar manages your domain registration, while the domain itself remains the same.

## Why transfer a domain?

There are several reasons you might want to transfer a domain. You may want to manage all your domains with a single registrar for easier administration. You may prefer a different registrar's features, pricing, or customer support. You may want to use a registrar that integrates better with your other services or tools. Different registrars also offer different pricing for domain registration and renewal.

## How does domain transfer work?

The domain transfer process involves several steps and parties. Most domain transfers require an authorization code that proves you have permission to transfer the domain. This code is obtained from your current registrar. You initiate the transfer at the new registrar by providing the domain name and authorization code. The current registrant email address receives a transfer approval email that must be confirmed to authorize the transfer. Once approved, the registry processes the transfer, which can take several days depending on the top-level domain (TLD). After the registry processes the transfer, the domain is registered with the new registrar.

## Domain transfer requirements

Several requirements must be met before a domain can be transferred. Domains must typically be registered for at least 60 days before they can be transferred. The domain must be unlocked at the current registrar, as some domains may have transfer locks that prevent transfers. Most TLDs require a valid authorization code to initiate the transfer. You must have access to the registrant email address to approve the transfer request. Expired domains may have restrictions on transfers, depending on the TLD and registry policies.

## Domain transfer locks

Transfer locks are security mechanisms that prevent unauthorized domain transfers. A registrar lock is applied by your domain registrar and prevents the domain from being transferred to another registrar. A registry lock is applied at the registry level and provides additional security. After changing registrant information, domains are locked from transfers for 60 days under ICANN policy. Some registrars offer additional lock features, such as SuperLock, that provide enhanced protection against unauthorized transfers.

## Transfer duration

Domain transfers typically take between 1 and 7 days to complete, depending on the top-level domain being transferred, how quickly the transfer approval email is confirmed, registry processing times, and whether any issues arise during the transfer process. During the transfer process, your domain continues to function normally. DNS resolution is not affected by the transfer, as long as your name servers remain unchanged.

## What happens during transfer?

During a domain transfer, your domain's DNS resolution is not interrupted. The transfer process does not affect how your domain resolves or which name servers are used. Most domain transfers add one year to your domain's registration period. Contact information may be updated as part of the transfer process, which can trigger additional locks or validation requirements. Services like DNS hosting, email forwarding, and SSL certificates may need to be reconfigured after the transfer, depending on your setup.

## Transfer vs. other domain operations

It's important to understand the difference between domain transfer and other domain operations. Transferring a domain is different from renewing it. A transfer moves the domain to a new registrar, while renewal extends the registration period with the current registrar. Changing your domain's name servers (DNS delegation) is separate from transferring the domain registration. You can change DNS providers without transferring the domain. Moving a domain between accounts at the same registrar is different from transferring to a different registrar.
