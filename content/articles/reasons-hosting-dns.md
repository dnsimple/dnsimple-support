# Why Should I Host My DNS with DNSimple?

## Effortless DNS and domain management plus expert support

DNSimple provides a clean, easy-to-use web interface and [API](https://dnsimple.com/api) for domain registration and management. We simplify domain and DNS management by focusing on DNS and domains. This lets us do everything from improving our API to allow automated domain registration and transfers, to enhancing our web interface to make it easier to use.

We have expert-level [customer support](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/dnsimple-support/) along with robust documentation for any questions you might have. When you email <support@dnsimple.com>, you'll get replies from experts at DNSimple who care about you, your business, and your DNS. We make every effort to resolve DNS issues. And we're always straightforward about what our service can and can't do.

## The best hosted DNS service

Choosing DNSimple gives you access to Anycast domain name service with globally distributed name servers for faster responses and increased reliability. You'll also have access to innovative records like [ALIAS](/articles/alias-record/), [URL](/articles/url-record/), and [POOL](/articles/pool-record/) for easier domain management, and simplified integration with many services.

We take [security](/articles/account-securing/) seriously and ensure your domains are as safe as possible. We support [multiple users](/articles/account-users/) for Teams accounts, and allow you to control different levels of [domain access](/articles/domain-access-control/), so you can make sure the right people on your team have access to your domains.

We also believe in choosing the best tooling to get the job done. With no vendor lock-in, you can point your name servers wherever you choose. If you want to keep your domain registered elsewhere, and just use our DNS resolver or [email forwarding](/articles/email-forwarding/), you can still use our name servers.
