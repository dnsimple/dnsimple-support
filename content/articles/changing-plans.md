# Change Subscription Plan

As a DNSimple customer, you might require features that aren't available on your current plan. This article discusses how to switch to the most appropriate subscription to meet your current needs. You can explore the various options and get an estimate of your costs on our [pricing page](https://dnsimple.com/pricing).

<info>
We do not offer refunds for plan changes. If you upgrade your plan, you will receive a proration credit for the time remaining on your previous plan. If you downgrade, we wait until the end of the billing cycle, then charge you for the new subscription.

## Upgrading your plan

If you **upgrade** your subscription before your monthly renewal, **the changes take effect and are billed immediately**.

You will receive a prorated discount corresponding to the unused time in your current subscription plan. This credit doesn't include extra items like email forwards or active zones, as these are pay-per-use features. These will be billed again as part of the plan change.

Read more about [subscription proration](/articles/understanding-invoice/#proration).

## Downgrading your plan

If you **downgrade** your subscription, **the changes will be billed at the end of your current billing cycle**, along with your subscription renewal. All changes take effect at the time of renewal.

There is no proration credit for downgrades. We wait until the end of the billing cycle, then change your plan.

You can cancel these plan changes in your account settings:

1.  Once the change is complete, you'll receive the corresponding invoice.

## Incompatible features

When downgrading your account, you might not be able to use some features from your current plan. Common issues you may encounter are: [removing scoped access tokens](/articles/api-access-token/#removing-an-account-access-token), [removing URL records for https redirects](/articles/manage-url-record/#removing-a-url-record), and [removing seats](/articles/managing-seats/#decreasing-the-number-of-seats), among others.
