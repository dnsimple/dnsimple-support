# Guide: A Quick Tour of Your Dashboard and Domain List

Your dashboard and Domain List let you manage all of your domains across your accounts.

The dashboard displays all of your accounts side-by-side. You can be a member of one or many accounts, managing your personal domains alongside company domains. Learn more in this [support article](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/dashboard/), or take a video tour to see how it works.

The next stop is your Domain List. Here, you'll see the domains in your account, along with basic information for each, like if the domain is registered with DNSimple, has an active zone, certificates, and more. You can read about your [Domain List](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/domain-list/), or watch our video tour to learn more.
