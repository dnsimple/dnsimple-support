# Auto-Renewal Required Domains

Certain domain names require auto-renewal and cannot be renewed manually. For these domains, it's important to have the [auto-renewal feature](/articles/domain-auto-renewal) turned on at least one month before the expiration date.

<warning>
Auto-renewals are automatically processed by the registrar within 30 days of expiration. Enabling auto-renew on a domain within 30 days of the expiration date will not ensure automatic renewal, and **you risk losing your domain**. If your domain enters the [redemption period](/articles/what-happens-when-domain-expires/#redemption-period), the registrar will likely charge a fee to recover it. Read more about [what happens when a domain expires](/articles/what-happens-when-domain-expires/). 
</warning>

The best solution is to always have auto-renewal enabled. We send a notification to the registrant's email address two months before a domain is auto-renewed, so you can disable auto-renewal if you don't want to keep the domain.

For more information, visit the [TLD-specific articles](/categories/domains/). If a domain requires auto-renewal, we will alert you with a message on your DNSimple account page in the renewal section of the domain.
