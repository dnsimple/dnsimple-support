# Managing Integrated Domains

From the Domains page, you can view the refreshed state of your DNSimple domains alongside domains from [integrated domain providers](/articles/integrated-domain-providers).

##### Viewing integrated domains from the Domains page

Loading the Domains page automatically refreshes the current state of integrated domains and imports any new domains from linked integrated domain providers.
