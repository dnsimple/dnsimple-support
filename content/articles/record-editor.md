## How to use DNSimple's Record Editor

The Record Editor is DNSimple's DNS editor. It lets you view, add, update, and delete DNS records for your domain in DNSimple.

Any supported [DNS record](/articles/supported-dns-records/) type can be managed from the Record Editor, except [system records](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/system-records/).

You'll need access to the account or domain to make changes. Make sure the domain is delegated to DNSimple so your records propagate.

## Accessing the Record Editor
**Option 1: From the top navigation bar**
1. Use the account switcher at the top of the page to select the appropriate account.
1. From the Domain Names list, click the domain you want to manage
1. Click the DNS tab on the left.
1. Locate the DNS record section and click Manage 

**Option 2: From the domain page**
1. Use the **account switcher** at the top of the page to select the appropriate account.
1. From the **Domain Names** list, click the domain you want to manage.
1. On the domain page, click **DNS** at the top-right of the screen (next to the star icon). This takes you directly to the Record Editor.

## Managing integrated zone records
The Record Editor is also used to manage records for your integrated zones. Refer to [Record Editor for Integrated Zones](/articles/record-editor-integrated-zones/)  for more details.

## Viewing Activity in the Record Editor
From the Record Editor, you can also view the Activity log to see who made changes to your domain. This helps you track updates and keep an audit trail of all DNS changes.

- If you're on the Teams plan or higher, you'll see the full activity history.
- If you're on the Solo plan, you can view the last 30 days of activity.

For step-by-step instructions and filtering options, see [How to View the Activity Log](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/activity-tracking/).
