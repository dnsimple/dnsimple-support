# Deleting Yourself as a User

Deleting yourself as a user will permanently delete all your domains in all your accounts, records, and all associated information. If you prefer to retain this information for future use at DNSimple, consider [unsubscribing](/articles/cancel-subscription/) instead.

> [!WARNING]
> Once you delete yourself as a user, all your domains and records will be deleted. You'll no longer be able to request transfer codes or unlock registered domains to transfer them to another registrar.
> [!NOTE]
> To delete yourself as a user, you'll first need to [unsubscribe your accounts from your plan at DNSimple](/articles/cancel-subscription/).
