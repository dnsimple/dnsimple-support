# Deleting Yourself as a User

Deleting yourself as a user will permanently delete all your domains in all your accounts, records, and all associated information.

<warning>
Once you delete yourself as a user, all your domains and records will be deleted. You'll no longer be able to request transfer codes or unlock registered domains to transfer them to another registrar.
</warning>
<note>
To delete yourself as a user, you'll first need to [unsubscribe your accounts from your plan at DNSimple](/articles/cancel-subscription).
</note>

<div class="section-steps" markdown="1">
##### To permanently delete yourself as a user, along with all your domains and records:

1. Go to [your User Settings page](https://dnsimple.com/user):

    ![Navigate to user settings page](/files/access-user-settings.jpg)

1. Click on the <label>Delete user</label> button at the bottom of the page:

     ![Delete user](/files/delete-user.png)

   The <label>Delete user</label> button will only show up if you have no active DNSimple subscriptions.

## Deleting an account
It's not possible for a customer to independently delete an account that was created with the multi-account feature. If you want to delete one of your accounts, please [contact us](https://dnsimple.com/contact) so we can sort it out for you.
