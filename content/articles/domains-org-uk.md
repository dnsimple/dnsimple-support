This article explains the requirements and special procedures for .ORG.UK domain names.

For information about transfers and ownership changes that apply to all .UK domains (including .ORG.UK), see the [.UK Domains](/articles/domains-uk/) article.

## Registering a .ORG.UK domain {#registering}

.ORG.UK is intended for non-profit organizations, charities, and community groups. Registration is open to organizations worldwide, though the domain is primarily used by UK-based non-profit organizations.

## Transfer expiration extension

.ORG.UK domains may or may not be extended when they are successfully transferred. If your .ORG.UK domain has less than 3 months remaining before expiration, then it will be extended by 2 years. The price of this extension is included in the transfer fee. If your .ORG.UK domain has 3 or more months remaining, then it will not be automatically extended.
