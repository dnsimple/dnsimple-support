# Transferring Account Ownership

You can transfer account ownership by [changing the user email](/articles/changing-email#changing-the-user-email) to that of the individual taking over the account. They can then [request a password reset](/articles/forgot-password/). If you run into any issues with this, please [reach out to us](https://dnsimple.com/contact) so we can help further.

## A note about accounts

When you initially sign up as a user in our system, we create an account bound to that user. We call this the Primary Account, and the email address is the same as the username. If you change the email address for that user, the account email address will also be updated. That way customers with a single account only have to update their email in one place. Follow the instructions in [Changing User Email](/articles/changing-email#changing-the-user-email) if this is the case for you.

Extra accounts have their own email addresses that can be [changed ad-hoc](/articles/changing-email#changing-the-account-email). This way there's a distinction between the [account email address](/articles/changing-email/#changing-the-account-email) and the [user email address](/articles/changing-email/#changing-the-user-email).
