# Transferring Account Ownership

You can transfer account ownership by [changing the user email](/articles/changing-email#changing-the-user-email) to that of the individual taking over the account. They can then [request a password reset](/articles/forgot-password/). If you run into any issues with this, please [reach out to us](https://dnsimple.com/contact) so we can help further.
