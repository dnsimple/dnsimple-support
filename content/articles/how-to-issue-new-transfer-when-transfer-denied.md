# How can I issue a new transfer order when a transfer is denied?

If you receive a message from your current registrar that a domain transfer was denied it is likely for one of the following reasons:

- the domain is locked
- the domain was registered within the last 60 days
- the domain has whois privacy turned on

Before you can submit a new transfer request you'll need to wait until the current open transfer request is closed. Most domain registries only allows one transfer request for a domain at a time and they do not allow transfer requests to be cancelled by the requesting registrar once they're issued to the registry.

Once the currently open transfer closes then make sure to unlock the domain at the current registrar, ensure it is not private, and then reissue the transfer from the DNSimple web site by going to your domain list and clicking on the <label>Transfer</label> button for the domain or by going to <label>Manage</label> for the domain and transferring it from there.
