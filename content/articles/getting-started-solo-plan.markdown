## Step 1: Preparing your account

1. [Account activation](/articles/account-activation/) is easy and includes a free 30-day trial. You can cancel at any time during your 30-day trial without being charged. During the course of your trial, you're free to [change plans](/articles/changing-plans/) to try different features.
2. Secure your account with [multi-factor authentication](/articles/multi-factor-authentication/). Multi-factor authentication is a security measure that helps protect you from unwanted access to your account and increases the security of your data.
3. Learn how to read and [understand your DNSimple invoice](/articles/understanding-invoice/).

## Step 2: Adding your domains

Transferring an existing domain into DNSimple, registering a new domain, or delegating your domain to us can be done by following these guides:

- [Transfer an existing domain](#transferring-an-existing-domain)
- [Register a new domain](#registering-a-new-domain)
- [Delegate your domain to DNSimple](#delegating-your-domain-to-dnsimple)

### Transferring an existing domain

Transferring a domain name to DNSimple is the process of moving your [domain registration](https://dnsimple.com/tlds) to DNSimple. DNSimple will act as a domain registrar. You'll be able to manage your entire domain configuration in your DNSimple account.

Check out [this guide](https://dnsimple.com/how-to-transfer-without-downtime) on how to transfer your domain with no downtime.

### Registering a new domain

There are two reasons to register a domain with DNSimple: when it's a newly purchased domain or when you're already managing the DNS for a domain.

### Delegating your domain to DNSimple

Have you registered a domain elsewhere but want to manage the DNS records with DNSimple? Pointing the name servers to DNSimple will cause the domain to resolve using the DNS records configured in your DNSimple account.

## Step 3: Configuring DNS records for your domain

Once your domains have been added, it's important to configure DNS records for them. This ensures people can reach your web site, send you email, and so on.

The two most common records you're likely to configure are `A` and `CNAME` records. Follow the links below to read more about them.

- [A Records](/articles/a-record/)
- [CNAME Records](/articles/cname-record/)

Alternatively, set up DNS records for common platforms such as Google Workspace, Shopify, or WordPress using our [one-click services](/articles/services/).

<note>
Make sure to [check your nameservers](/articles/pointing-domain-to-dnsimple/). If your domain isn't delegated to DNSimple, [changes you make to DNS records](/articles/record-editor/) won't resolve.
</note>
