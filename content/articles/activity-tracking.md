Activity history offers a comprehensive view of all changes made to a specific domain or across your entire account. It lets you manage your domain management and understand any modifications made over time.

Below, you'll find how to access and use activity tracking at both the domain and account levels, along with information on how to filter events to find exactly what you're looking for.

## Domain activity tracking

Domain-level activity tracking can be found under the domain's management page.

Locate the domain on your [Domain List](/articles/domain-list/). Click the domain name to access the **Overview** page.

Click **View** on the **Activity** card to view a detailed log of changes to the domain.

## Events filter

The Events Filter displays custom event types within a chosen time frame, depending on whether you're interested in specific DNS changes, user actions, or time-specific events. Each entry provides detailed information, including:

- What changed, along with contextual data (e.g. records content)
- Which user triggered the event
- When the event took place
