Activity history offers a comprehensive audit log of all changes made to a specific domain or across your entire account. It lets you manage your domain management and understand any modifications made over time.

## Why activity tracking matters

Activity tracking provides accountability and transparency in domain management, especially important in team environments. It helps you identify who made specific changes, when they were made, and what exactly changed. This is valuable for troubleshooting issues, understanding the impact of changes, and maintaining security by detecting unauthorized modifications. The audit log creates a historical record that can be reviewed to understand how a domain's configuration evolved over time.

Activity tracking records changes made through the DNSimple interface and API, but it does not track changes made outside of DNSimple, such as direct registry modifications or changes made through integrated domain providers' interfaces.

## Domain activity tracking

Domain-level activity tracking provides an audit log of all changes made to a specific domain. This includes DNS record modifications, contact updates, name server changes, and other domain-specific operations. Each entry shows what changed, who made the change, and when it occurred.

## Account activity tracking

Account-level activity tracking provides an audit log of changes across your entire account, including:

- Adjustments to account settings
- Modifications affecting multiple domains
- User actions and changes in permissions

This broader view helps you understand changes that affect the account as a whole, not just individual domains.

## Events filter

The **Events** filter displays custom event types within a chosen time frame, depending on whether you're interested in specific DNS changes, user actions, or time-specific events. Each entry provides detailed information, including:

- What changed, along with contextual data (e.g. records content)
- Which user triggered the event
- When the event took place
