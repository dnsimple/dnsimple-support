DNSimple supports reverse DNS entries (i.e. PTR records). This feature is available on certain plans. [See the difference between plans](/articles/differences-between-dnsimple-plans/). Please ensure you can delegate the portion of the subnet you want us to respond to for reverse DNS queries.

Depending on your DNS host, you may not have control over your subnet. In that case, you'll need to ask your hosting company to set up the reverse DNS entries you require.
