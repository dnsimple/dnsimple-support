# Reverse DNS Zones

<info>
This article describes a feature only available on the following plans: Professional and Enterprise.

This feature is not available on our Legacy Plans. Click [here](/articles/changing-plans/) to change your plan, and unlock this feature.
</info>

DNSimple supports reverse DNS entries (i.e. PTR records). This feature is available on our Professional and Enterprise plans. Please ensure you can delegate the portion of the subnet you want us to respond to for reverse DNS queries.

Depending on your DNS host, you may not have control over your subnet. In that case, you'll need to ask your hosting company to set up the reverse DNS entries you require.
