# Managing CAA Records

### Table of Contents {#toc}

* TOC
{:toc}

You can manage [CAA records](/articles/caa-record/) in DNSimple using the [DNS record editor](/articles/record-editor/).

The instructions in this article assume you're familiar with the [CAA record format](/articles/caa-record-format/) and usage.

<note>
CAA records are only supported on the [DNSimple name servers](/articles/dnsimple-nameservers/). We don't support transferring CAA records to secondary name servers.
</note>

## Standard mode vs custom mode

The DNSimple interface allows you to manage CAA records using two different modes:

- The standard mode provides a pre-populated interface to help enter the appropriate values for the CAA record.
    - **Provider** allows you to create a CAA record to allow a certificate authority.
    - **Reports** allows you to create a CAA record to specify the email for reporting policy violations.
- The custom mode (**Custom**) allows you to modify the CAA record tag/value values directly.

We don't support the ability to specify via interface the destructured CAA record value representation. You **cannot** enter the following text:

```
0 issue "letsencrypt.com"
```

## Adding a CAA record

    - _Name_: the subdomain you want to create the record for, without the domain name. For example, if you want to represent `www.example.com` enter `www`. Leave it blank to represent the root domain `example.com`.
    - _Provider_: the Certificate Authority you want to allow.
    - _Certificate type_: the type you want to allow.

    As with any other DNS record, you can configure:

    - _TTL_: the record [time-to-live](/articles/what-is-ttl/).
    - _Respond From Regions_: Configure [Regional Records](/articles/regional-records/) if desired.
    - _Notes_: Optionally include a [record note](/articles/record-notes/).

    Once you're ready, click <label>Add Record</label> to confirm and create the record.

1.  The record is created and visible in the record list.

</div>

<note>
Some hosting providers label fields differently than DNSimple does, which can be confusing if you're copying DNS settings from another provider.
- In DNSimple, **Name** = what others might call _Host._
</note>
