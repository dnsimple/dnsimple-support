DNSimple subscriptions renew each month. The payment for the renewal will be charged to the card on file or, if you have credit, deducted from the credit balance.

For Solo and Teams plans, the amount charged depends on:

- The base price of your subscription (Teams only)
- The number of seats (Teams only)
- The number of domains in your account with active zones
- The query volume of your domains
- The number of email forwards configured

Enterprise and Reseller clients have custom contracts based on their individual needs.

You can view your next renewal date and your account balance on the account page.

## What happens when my subscription is renewed?

You will receive an invoice when the renewal is successfully processed, and your subscription will be extended for the duration of your plan's billing cycle. You can view your billing cycle dates on your invoice. For assistance reading your invoice, see [Understanding Your Invoice](/articles/understanding-invoice/) for more details.

## What happens if a renewal payment fails?

If your renewal payment fails, you will receive a [dunned invoice](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/account-invoice-history/#invoice-state-dunned), along with an email that details the failure and steps you can take to fix the issue(s).

Your account **will not** immediately be canceled, and your domains will continue to resolve. 

From the date of the first failed payment attempt, you will have **21 days** to fix the issue and finalize the payment. 

Our system will attempt to collect payment once a week during this period, and we will notify the email associated with your account whether the attempt has failed or succeeded. You can also manually retry payments for renewal fees â€”- [learn how](/articles/account-invoice-history#retrying).

If you know you cannot provide a valid card number before your subscription is canceled, please [contact us](https://dnsimple.com/contact).

## What happens if my subscription is canceled?

If your subscription is canceled because of too many failed renewal attempts, we will immediately notify you by email, and all services provided by DNSimple will stop. Learn more about [what happens if you stop paying for your subscription](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/what-happens-if-i-stop-paying).

You have the option to [reactivate a canceled subscription](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/reactivate-subscription).
