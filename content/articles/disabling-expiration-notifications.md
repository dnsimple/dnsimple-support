# Disabling Expiration Notifications

If you've disabled auto-renewal on the domain you want to let expire, simply toggle the checkbox <label>Email me when this domain is about to expire</label> which appears on the card showing the registration status of your domain management page of non-auto-renewing domains.

Be careful with this feature. You won't get any notifications of expiration of domains for which you disable these notifications.
