This article explains the requirements and special procedures for .AU domain names. DNSimple supports registration, renewal, and transfer of [.AU](https://dnsimple.com/tlds/au-domains) second-level domains and [.COM.AU](https://dnsimple.com/tlds/com-au-domains), [.ORG.AU](https://dnsimple.com/tlds/org-au-domains), and [.NET.AU](https://dnsimple.com/tlds/net-au-domains) third-level domains.

### .ORG.AU

To register a .ORG.AU domain name, registrants must belong to one of the following:

- An association incorporated in any Australian State or Territory.
- A political party registered with the Australian Electoral Commission.
- A trade union or other organization registered under the Workplace Relations Act 1996.
- A sporting or special interest club operating in Australia.
- A charity operating in Australia, as defined in the Registrant's constitution or other documents of incorporation.
- A non-profit organization operating in Australia, as defined in the Registrant's constitution or other documents of incorporation.

<warning>
A valid Australian Business Number (ABN) is required to register a .ORG.AU domain name. Australian Company Numbers and Trademark Numbers are not acceptable.
</warning>

On April 12, 2021, a new set of rules for the .ORG.AU third-level domain took effect — review them [here](https://www.auda.org.au/au-domain-names/new-au-licensing-rules/orgau-rule-changes).

## Renewals

.AU domains must be renewed no later than 10 days before the expiration date. Automatic and manual renewals are permitted as long as the domain is less than 90 days away from expiry. If the domain name is not renewed by the deadline, it enters the [redemption](/articles/what-happens-when-domain-expires/#redemption-period) period. The domain name will be removed from the DNS and cannot be updated. This period lasts for 31 days. During this period, the domain name can be [restored](/articles/restoring-domain/) for an additional fee.

If the domain name is not redeemed within 31 days, it will be removed from our system and will no longer be recoverable. It will be purged by the registry during the next purge cycle.

## Transfers

.AU domains are not renewed for one year upon transfer. We do not charge for .AU transfers.

### Required acknowledgment

All .AU domain transfers into DNSimple require your explicit acknowledgment before they can be completed.

After initiating the transfer, you will receive the acknowledgement email within the same day. Once acknowledgment is completed, your transfer will take up to a week to complete. There are no further steps needed after acknowledging the transfer.

<warning>
All unacknowledged transfers will be canceled after 14 days.
</warning>

#### Acknowledgment process

##### Check your email
An acknowledgment email will be sent to the domain registrant's email address <strong>(this may be different from your DNSimple account email)</strong>.

If you do not have access to the registrant's email address, we recommend updating this first via the domain's current registrar. Otherwise, your transfer won't succeed.

If you don't see the email, check your spam/junk folders.

##### Complete the process
Click the link provided in the acknowledgment email to confirm and complete your transfer.

If you don't receive the acknowledgement email, experience problems with the link, or need any help with your domain transfer, please [contact](https://dnsimple.com/contact) our support team.

## Changes in ownership

Any contact change that results in a change of registrant must be executed manually. A change of registrant occurs when you are modifying the *Organization Name*, *First/Last Name*, *Eligibility ID type*, or *Eligibility ID number*.

There's an additional fee to change the ownership of a .AU domain — this fee includes a one-year extension of the domain registration, effective from the date the change is completed.

If you want to make this change, [contact us](https://dnsimple.com/contact), and we'll be happy to help.

### Inactive or deregistered eligibility ID type

If your domain has an inactive or canceled ABN/ACN, the registrant must reactivate the existing eligibility ID type number on record before the registration can be transferred or renewed.

- [ABR: Cancel/re-apply for an ABN](https://www.abr.business.gov.au/ContactUs/Activate)
- [ASIC: Reinstating a deregistered company](https://asic.gov.au/for-business/closing-your-company/reinstating-a-deregistered-company/)

Where an Australian trademark number is no longer valid, the registration must provide alternative business information — either an ABN/ACN or a new trademark number — to maintain their eligibility to retain the registration.

If your domain has a deregistered ABN/ACN (where the legal entity has been deregistered or is deceased), the registry requires the following additional forms:

- [Statutory Declaration](/files/victoria-stat-dec-template.doc)
- [Transfer of Domain Name Chain of Title Form](/files/transfer-of-domain-name-chain-of-title.docx)

Please complete them to the best of your abilities — if you have any concerns, please [contact the registry directly](https://www.auda.org.au/au-domain-names/general-enquiry-form).
