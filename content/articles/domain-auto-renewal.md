Most auto-renewals will begin a few days before a domain's expiration date. We deliver auto-renewal and expiration notices starting two months before a domain's expiration date.

Auto-renewal reduces the risk of a domain expiring by renewing the domain automatically days before expiration. When auto-renewal is turned on for a domain, we'll attempt to renew it automatically prior to expiration. We'll bill your credit card if the renewal is successful.

## When does auto-renewal happen?

Auto-renewals are processed automatically and usually occur days before the domain's expiration date. The exact timeline may vary for each domain.

Your domain has two key dates related to its auto-renewal lifecycle: the expiration date and the renew by date. For most TLDs (like .COM, .NET, and .ORG), the renew by date falls after the expiration date. This means that even if the domain technically expires, it can still be renewed, and if auto-renewal is enabled, the renewal will happen automatically after expiration. During this time, the domain remains fully functional and continues to resolve normally. The domain is not at risk, and renewal will complete as scheduled by the renew by date.

For some other TLDs (like .EU), domains are renewed before they expire, so the renew by date will be before the expiration date.

<info>
Refunds are not possible if a domain has already auto-renewed.

### ICANN expiration warning

ICANN domains where the renew by date falls after the expiration date will receive a notification email that may state the domain has expired. However, if your domain has auto-renewal enabled, there is no cause for concern — the domain will automatically renew as scheduled, and it will remain active and fully functional in the meantime.

## Enabling auto-renewal

You can enable auto-renewal when you first register a domain or any time after the domain has been registered.

Newly registered domains are set to auto-renew by default. If you turned off auto-renewal and want to re-enable it for your domain, follow these steps:

<div class="section-steps" markdown="1">
##### To enable auto-renewal for a domain

1. If you have more than one account, select the relevant one from the account switcher in the top-right corner of the screen.
1. On the header click the <label>Domain Names</label> tab. Click the relevant domain name to access the domain page.
1. In the **Overview** tab, check <label>Auto-renew this domain before it expires</label> on the **Registration status** card.

Auto-renewal is now enabled on your domain.

[Some registries require that domains renew through auto-renewal](/articles/auto-renew-only-domains/). If you disable auto-renewal for a domain that requires auto-renewal to renew, you risk losing the domain.
