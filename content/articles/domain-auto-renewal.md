<warning>
Auto-renewals begin the renewal process 30 days before the domain is set to expire. You cannot turn off the auto-renewal process during this time. We deliver auto-renewal and expiration notices starting two months before the domain's expiration date. Please update your auto-renewal preferences before it reaches the 30-day threshold.
</warning>

Auto-renewal reduces the risk of a domain expiring by renewing the domain automatically within 30 days of expiration. When auto-renewal is turned on for a domain, we'll attempt to renew it automatically prior to expiration. We'll bill your credit card if the renewal is successful.

## When does auto-renewal happen?

Auto-renewals are processed automatically and usually occur within 30 days before the domain's expiration date. This timeline may vary for each domain.

Auto-renewal cannot be turned on if the domain is within 30 days of expiration. Enabling auto-renewal a few days before expiration will **not** ensure the domain is automatically renewed – increasing the risk of losing the domain. Likewise, if you want to let a domain expire and turn off auto-renewal within 30 days of expiration, the domain may already be auto-renewed, and you will not be refunded for it.

## Enabling Auto-Renewal

You can enable auto-renewal when you first register a domain or any time after the domain has been registered. 

Newly registered domains are set to auto-renew by default. If you turned off auto-renewal and want to re-enable it for your domain, follow these steps:

<div class="section-steps" markdown="1">
##### To enable auto-renewal for a domain

1.  If you have more than one account, select the relevant one.
1.  On the header click the <label>Domains</label> tab, locate the relevant domain, and click it to access the domain page.
1.  Check the <label>Auto-renew this domain before it expires</label> checkbox on the "Registration" status card.

Auto-renewal is now enabled on your domain.
</div>

## Disabling auto-renewal

<warning>
[Some registries require that domains renew through auto-renewal](/articles/auto-renew-only-domains/). If you disable auto-renewal for a domain that requires auto-renewal to renew, you risk losing the domain.
</warning>

To turn off auto-renewal for a domain, follow these steps:

<div class="section-steps" markdown="1">
