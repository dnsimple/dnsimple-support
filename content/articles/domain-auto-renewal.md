<warning>
Auto-renewals begin the renewal process 30 days before the domain is set to expire. You cannot turn off the auto-renewal process during this time. We deliver auto-renewal and expiration notices starting 2 months prior to the domain's expiration date. Please update your auto-renewal preferences before it reaches the 30-day threshold.
</warning>

Auto-renewal reduces the risk of a domain expiring by renewing the domain automatically within 30 days of expiration. When auto-renewal is turned on for a domain, we'll attempt to renew it automatically prior to expiration. We'll bill your credit card if the renewal is successful.

## When does auto-renewal happen?

Auto-renewal usually occurs within 30 days prior to the domain's expiration date. As such, this figure may vary from domain to domain.

You can enable auto-renewal when you first register a domain or any time after the domain has been registered. However, it cannot be turned on within 30 days of the expiration date.

Auto-renewals are processed automatically within the final 30 days of registration. Enabling auto-renewal a few days before expiration is not enough to ensure the domain is automatically renewed – increasing the risk of losing the domain. Likewise, if you want to let a domain expire but you turn off auto-renewal a few days before the expiration, the domain may already be auto-renewed and you can't get a refund for it.

## Enabling Auto-Renewal

Newly registered domains are set to auto-renew by default. If you've turned off auto-renewal and want to re-enable it for your domain, follow these steps:

<div class="section-steps" markdown="1">
##### To enable auto-renewal for a domain

1.  Log in to DNSimple with your user credentials.
1.  If you have more than one account, select the relevant one.
1.  On the header click the <label>Domains</label> tab, locate the relevant domain, and click on the name to access the domain page.
1.  Check the <label>Auto-renew this domain before it expires</label> checkbox on the "Registration" status card

1.  Auto-renewal is now enabled on your domain.
</div>

## Disabling auto-renewal

<warning>
[Some registries require that domains renew through auto-renewal](/articles/auto-renew-only-domains/). If you disable auto-renewal for a domain that requires auto-renewal to renew, you risk losing the domain.
