<warning>
Most auto-renewals will begin a few days before a domain's expiration date. We deliver auto-renewal and expiration notices starting two months before a domain's expiration date, even if auto-renewal is turned on.

Auto-renewal reduces the risk of a domain expiring by renewing the domain automatically days before expiration. When auto-renewal is turned on for a domain, we'll attempt to renew it automatically prior to expiration. We'll bill your credit card if the renewal is successful.

## When does auto-renewal happen?

Auto-renewals are processed automatically and usually occur days before the domain's expiration date. The exact timeline may vary for each domain. .IT domains are the exception — they are renewed after the expiration date, as per the rules set by the registry.

<info>
Refunds are not possible for domain auto-renewals.

## Enabling auto-renewal

You can enable auto-renewal when you first register a domain or any time after the domain has been registered.

Newly registered domains are set to auto-renew by default. If you turned off auto-renewal and want to re-enable it for your domain, follow these steps:

<div class="section-steps" markdown="1">
##### To enable auto-renewal for a domain

1. If you have more than one account, select the relevant one from the account switcher in the top-right corner of the screen.
1. On the header click the <label>Domain Names</label> tab. Click the relevant domain name to access the domain page.
1. In the **Overview** tab, check <label>Auto-renew this domain before it expires</label> on the **Registration status** card.

Auto-renewal is now enabled on your domain.

## Disabling auto-renewal

<warning>
Auto-renewal cannot be turned off if the auto-renewal is being processed.
</warning>

<warning>
[Some registries require that domains renew through auto-renewal](/articles/auto-renew-only-domains/). If you disable auto-renewal for a domain that requires auto-renewal to renew, you risk losing the domain.
</warning>

To turn off auto-renewal for a domain, follow these steps:

<div class="section-steps" markdown="1">
##### To disable auto-renewal for a domain
