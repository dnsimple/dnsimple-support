This article explains the requirements and special procedures for .CM domain names.


## Domain Restrictions on a .CM domain {#domain-restrictions}

If the name servers of a .CM domain are modified more than three to four times in a 30-day period, the domain is set to serverUpdateProhibited for the next four weeks.

<warning>
.CM domains cannot be restored. If the domain is not renewed before the expiration date, it will be deleted. There is no [grace period](/articles/what-happens-when-domain-expires/#grace-period) or [redemption period](/articles/what-happens-when-domain-expires/#redemption-period) for .CM domains.
</warning>
