When creating an application that requires access to DNSimple or letting an external application request authorization to private details in a user's DNSimple account without getting their password, you'll need an OAuth token.

If you only need basic access to the API, a regular [user or account token](/articles/api-access-token/) can be used instead.

## What is OAuth?

OAuth 2 is a protocol that lets external applications request authorization to private details in a user's DNSimple account without getting their password. This is preferred over Basic Authentication, because tokens can be revoked by users at any time.

Developers need to register their application before starting. A registered OAuth application is assigned a unique client ID and client secret. **The client secret should not be shared.**

## Creating a new OAuth application

To generate an OAuth application, log in to your account, and navigate to your account page.

Once you're there, click on the <label>Automation</label> link in the left menu, then go to Developer Applications at the bottom of the screen.

Your applications are listed here. This also lets you create a new application or remove an existing one.

## Creating a new developer application

Click on the <label>New</label> link to add a new access token.

When you create a new application, you'll need to provide a few details, including Application Name, a Homepage URL, and an Authorization Callback URL.

<tip>
Adding an application description is optional.

When created, you'll be taken to the page with your new application, showing your Client ID and Client Secret.

<info>
Both the Client ID and Client Secret are unique to your application, and **the client secret should not be shared.**

## Revoking user tokens

You can revoke all user tokens for your application by clicking the 'Revoke' button.

This cannot be undone. All clients will lose access to your application.

## Deleting an application

To delete an application, click the 'Delete' button.

![Delete Application](/files/delete-application.png)

This action cannot be undone, and will permanently delete your application. Any clients using the application will no longer be able to access DNSimple.

When deleting an application, you'll receive a warning prompt to ensure you want to continue.
