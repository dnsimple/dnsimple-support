# What is the WHOIS Privacy Protection Service?

Most domain names registered through DNSimple, or any other domain registrar for that matter, require the collection of essential contact information, such as the registrant's name, email address, mailing address, phone number, etc. This information is used in case a dispute arises about the domain name.

This information is often displayed in the global Whois system (also known as WHOIS). Information displayed in the global WHOIS is public and can be viewed by anyone.

All DNSimple plans include WHOIS privacy service for TLDs that allow it. If you would like to see if the TLD supports WHOIS privacy service, visit the [TLD pricing page](https://dnsimple.com/tlds). Once you find the TLD you want to know about, click it and you will see **yes** or **no** listed for WHOIS privacy in the table. 

This service will replace the public information that you provide with an anonymous proxy identity in the public WHOIS database. This includes replacing your email address with a proxy email address and replacing your address and contact information with the information from an entity called "Whois Privacy Protection Service, Inc.".

The WHOIS privacy protection service is not provided directly by DNSimple, nor we are associated with the company Whois Privacy Protection Service, Inc.
