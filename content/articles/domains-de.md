This article explains the requirements and special procedures for .DE domain names.


## Transferring a .DE domain {#transferring}

Unlike standard gTLD domains, .DE has some unique transfer rules.


Following a successful transfer, the expiration of the domain is extended 1 year from the date of the transfer (not from the previous expiration). For example, if on 10 Mar, 2020 you transfer a domain that expires on 15 Sept, 2020, when the transfer completes, the new expiration date will be 10 Mar, 2021.
