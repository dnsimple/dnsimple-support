## Setting up at Divio Aldryn

To setup DNS for your custom domain complete the following steps:

1. Head over to [control.aldryn.com](https://control.aldryn.com) and navigate to the dashboard of your project.
2. Navigate to the **Domain Settings** section.
3. Add your custom domains (e.g *mysite.com* and *www.mysite.com*) by clicking the **Add Domain** button.
4. Make note of the value of **Aldryn Project Domain** as you'll need to provide it when activating the service.
