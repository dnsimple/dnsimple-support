DNSimple uses webhooks to deliver notifications via HTTP regarding changes or events in your account.

For more technical information, visit the [Webhook and Events section](https://developer.dnsimple.com/v2/webhooks/events/) in our API documentation.

## Managing Webhook recipients

1. Navigate to your account page.
2. Click the **Webhooks** tab on the left side.

This displays all the URLs where DNSimple publishes the events that happen in your account.

## Adding a recipient

1. Click **Add** to add a new recipient.

## Clearing suppression

Sometimes a webhook delivery fails. If an endpoint cannot be reached, the delivery is retried. If it keeps failing, the recipient will be marked as *Suppressed*, and no more events will be sent.

When there are suppressed recipients, an alert message appears. A red exclamation point next to a webhook indicates there's an issue and that the webhook is suppressed.

Click **Clear Suppression** to clear the suppression and allow the recipient to receive events again.
