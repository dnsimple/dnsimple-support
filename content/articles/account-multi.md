DNSimple allows a user to be associated with multiple accounts. This happens in two cases:

- The user is [added as a member to an existing account](/articles/managing-seats/).
- The user creates another account under their existing user profile.

Managing multiple accounts is a flexible way to access different levels of service and share domain management with other users. If you want to invite another user to manage domains on your account, [read this article](/articles/managing-seats/), and learn how to set access levels with [Domain Access Controls](/articles/domain-access-control/).

## Creating a separate account

To create another account under your existing user profile:

<div class="section-steps" markdown="1">
1. Click the account switcher at the top right of the screen then select <label>User settings</label>.

1. Scroll down to the **Accounts** card, and click <label>Add</label>.

    ![Add New Account link](/files/add-new-account-link.png)

1. Alternatively, you can click **+Add new account** from your dashboard to access the new account creation form.

1. Fill in the form with the details for your new account. Click <label>Create account</label>.

1. Once you submit the form, the account will be created. Activate it by clicking **Select plan** under the **Billing and plans** tab, and following the steps to choose [a plan](/articles/dnsimple-plans/).

</div>

## Switching among accounts

Select the account you want to view from the account switcher, and you'll be taken to the Domain List for that account.

Once you've selected an account, open the account switcher again and click **_Account settings_** to view details for the selected account.
