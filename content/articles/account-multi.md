DNSimple allows a user to be associated with multiple accounts. This happens in two cases:

- The user is [added as a member to an existing account](/articles/account-users)
- The user created a new account

Managing multiple accounts is a flexible way to access different levels of service and share domain management with other users.


## Creating a separate account

If you want to add another account to your user profile:

<div class="section-steps" markdown="1">
1. Visit the settings for your user profile by clicking the <label>Settings</label> link in the menu.

    ![Settings link](/files/access-user-settings.jpg)

1. Once there, follow the <label>Add new account</label> link.

    ![Add New Account link](/files/add-new-account-link.png)

1. You'll see a form you should fill in with the details for your new account.

    ![Add New Account form](/files/add-new-account-form.png)

1. Once you've submitted the new account form, the account is created. You can activate it by clicking the <label>Select plan</label>. You can configure other parts of your account from the top navigation menu before activating your account.

</div>


## Switching active accounts

Switching account context is easy. Select the account you'd like to use from the menu:

  ![Switch account](/files/account-switcher.jpg)

The new selected account name will appear on the navigation bar.
