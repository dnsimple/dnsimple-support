DNSimple allows a user to be associated with multiple accounts. This happens in two cases:

- The user is [added as a member to an existing account](/articles/account-users)
- The user creates another, separate account

Managing multiple accounts is a flexible way to access different levels of service and share domain management with other users. If you want to invite another user to manage domains on your account, [read this article](/articles/account-users/#adding-members-to-an-account), and learn how to set access levels with [Domain Access Controls](/articles/domain-access-control/).

## Creating a separate account

To create another account under your user profile:

<div class="section-steps" markdown="1">
1. Click <label>User settings</label> at the top right of the screen.

1. Once you submit the form, the account will be created. Activate it by clicking **Select plan** under the **Billing and plans** tab, and following the steps to choose [a plan](/articles/dnsimple-plans/).

## Switching among accounts

Select the account you want to view from the top bar of your dashboard, and you'll be taken to the Domain List for that account.

From your Domain List, click **_Account_** in the top right to view details for the selected account.
