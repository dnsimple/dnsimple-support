## Explanation of your invoice

Here's a closer look at what your invoice means:

## Charge types

DNSimple has both recurring charges and purchases. Purchases, such as the fees you pay for registering a domain or for buying a Standard or Wildcard SSL certificate, appear on a separate invoice from subscription fees. Purchases _can_ be recurring – for example, if you've enabled auto-renewal for a domain.

### Recurring charges

- DNSimple subscription
- [Email forwards](/articles/email-forwarding/)
- [Extra domain zones](/articles/dns-hosting/#extra-zones)

### Purchases

<info>
Domain registration charges can be recurring if you've enabled [auto-renewal](/articles/domain-auto-renewal/).
</info>

- Domain registrations
- Domain renewals
- Domain transfers
- Standard or Wildcard SSL certificates
- Whois Privacy


## Proration

When you change your plan, you'll receive a proration discount corresponding to the remaining days in your current subscription plan. This discount does not consider extras, like email forwards or extra zones, which you'll be billed for again as part of the plan change.

### Difference between "Unused time" and "Remaining time"

**Unused time** refers to the amount of time on the old plan that you paid for but aren't going to use. **Remaining time** refers to the amount of time that you're going to be on the new plan until the next billing cycle starts.

Example:

Your billing cycle starts on the 1st of the month. You're on the Personal monthly plan. On the 10th you switch to Professional:

- You will be returned 20 days of unused time on the Personal plan.
- You will be paying 20 days of remaining time on the Professional plan.
