## Charge types

DNSimple has both recurring charges and purchases. Purchases, such as the fees you pay for registering a domain or for buying a Standard or Wildcard SSL certificate, appear on a separate invoice from subscription fees. Purchases _can_ be recurring – for example, if you've enabled auto-renewal for a domain.

### Recurring charges

- DNSimple subscription
- [Email forwards](/articles/email-forwarding/)
- [Active Zones](/articles/dns-hosting)

![Recurring charges](/files/recurring-charges.png)

### Purchases

<info>
Domain registration charges can be recurring if you've enabled [auto-renewal](/articles/domain-auto-renewal/).
</info>

- Domain registrations
- Domain renewals
- Domain transfers
- Standard or Wildcard SSL certificates


## Proration

When you change your plan, you'll receive a proration discount corresponding to the remaining days in your current subscription plan. This discount does not consider extras, like email forwards or active zones, which you'll be billed for again as part of the plan change.
