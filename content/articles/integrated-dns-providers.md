DNSimple supports the ability to synchronize, manage, and view zones that are deployed in other DNS providers external to DNSimple. DNSimple calls these providers "Integrated DNS Providers" and zones ["integrated zones"](/articles/managing-integrated-zones).

## Supported features

- **Import integrated zones**: When you link an Integrated DNS Provider to your DNSimple account, zones hosted on that Integrated DNS Provider will be imported into DNSimple and listed on the [Domain Names](/articles/managing-integrated-zones) page.
- **Adding and removing integrated zones**: [Add](/articles/integrated-dns-providers#adding-a-zone-to-an-integrated-dns-provider) or [delete](/articles/integrated-dns-providers#removing-a-zone-from-an-integrated-dns-provider) zones to/from the Integrated DNS Provider, from within DNSimple.
- **Manage integrated zone records**: List, create, update, and delete integrated zone records from DNSimple using the [Record Editor](/articles/record-editor-integrated-zones).
- **Sync integrated zone records**: Sync your zone records from the integrated zone to DNSimple, or from DNSimple to the integrated zone, with the [Record Editor](/articles/record-editor-integrated-zones#record-syncing).

<info>
The list of supported features and record types differs for each Integrated Provider. See the provider page for more information.

## Supported Integrated DNS Providers {#supported-integrated-dns-providers}

To manage [integrated zones](/articles/managing-integrated-zones) from DNSimple, you first have to link an Integrated DNS Provider to your DNSimple account.

DNSimple supports zone integration with the providers listed below.

- [Amazon Route 53](/articles/integrated-dns-provider-amazon-route53)
- [Azure DNS](/articles/integrated-dns-provider-azure-dns)
- [CoreDNS](/articles/integrated-dns-provider-coredns)

## Supported record types {#supported-record-types}

Supported record types can be [synced](/articles/record-editor-integrated-zones#record-syncing) from/to DNSimple to/from an Integrated DNS Provider.
However, record fields not supported by DNSimple or the destination provider may be ignored. View the supported record types for [AWS Route 53](/articles/integrated-dns-provider-amazon-route53/#supported-record-types), [CoreDNS](/articles/integrated-dns-provider-coredns/#supported-features), and [Azure](/articles/integrated-dns-provider-azure-dns/#supported-record-types).

## Linking an Integrated DNS Provider to your account {#linking-an-integrated-dns-provider}

1. At DNSimple, go to the <label>Account</label> page, and click the <label>Integrated Providers</label> tab.
1. Under <label>Add an Integrated Provider<label>, click the link button for the Integrated DNS Provider you want to link to your DNSimple account.

1. Fill in any required paramaters for the Integrated DNS Provider configuration.
1. Fill in any necessary credentials for your account at the Integrated DNS Provider.
![Enter Integrated DNS Provider credentials](/files/account-external-provider-link-credentials.png)
1. After successfully linking the Integrated DNS Provider, you will arrive back on the DNSimple Integrated Providers page with the Integrated DNS Provider newly linked to your account, listed under "Linked providers". You can view the imported integrated zones from the [Domain Names](/articles/managing-integrated-zones) page, and manage and sync integrated zone records from the [Record Editor](/articles/record-editor-integrated-zones).

## Unlinking an Integrated DNS Provider from your account

1. At DNSimple, go to the <label>Account</label> page, and click the <label>Integrated Providers</label> tab.
1. Under <label>Linked providers<label>, click the <label>Remove</label> button for the Integrated DNS Provider you want to unlink from your DNSimple account. This will remove the ability to view and manage zones and their DNS records at the linked provider via DNSimple.

## Adding a zone to an Integrated DNS Provider {#adding-a-zone-to-an-integrated-dns-provider}

If you have an existing domain name in DNSimple, you can also add it to an Integrated DNS Provider from the DNS section of the domain management page. If the Integrated DNS Provider has not yet been [linked](/articles/integrated-dns-providers#linking-an-integrated-dns-provider) to your DNSimple account, you will be prompted to do so.

1.  Click on the DNS tab on the domain's management page.

    ![Domain DNS tab link](/files/domain-tab-dns-link.png)

1.  Click the <label>Link</label> button corresponding to the desired Integrated DNS Provider inside the <label>DNS Zone Providers</label> card.

    ![Adding a Zone from DNS Zone Providers](/files/dns-zone-providers-add-zone.png)

1.  If the Integrated DNS Provider is already linked to the DNSimple account, select the desired one (if there is more than one from the same provider type, e.g. Azure), and click <label>Link</label> to add the zone to the provider. For instance, if the provider is Azure, the zone will be added to Azure.

1.  If the Integrated DNS Provider is not already linked to the DNSimple account, you will have to input the prerequisite details to link it to the account before the zone can be added to the provider. The prerequisites for each Integrated DNS Provider can be found on each provider's support article [page](/articles/integrated-dns-providers#supported-integrated-dns-providers). The Integrated DNS Provider will be linked to the DNSimple account, and the zone will then be added to the provider.

## Removing a zone from an Integrated DNS Provider {#removing-a-zone-from-an-integrated-dns-provider}

If you've imported a zone into DNSimple from an Integrated Provider, you can use the DNS Zone Providers card to delete the zone at the Provider. This retains the zone and its records at DNSimple, but deletes them from the provider. In the case of [CoreDNS](/articles/integrated-dns-provider-coredns), the CoreDNS configuration for the zone will be deleted, causing DNS changes for the zone to no longer sync with the CoreDNS cluster.

1.  Click on the DNS tab on the domain's management page.

    ![Domain DNS tab link](/files/domain-tab-dns-link.png)

1.  Click on the <label>Remove</label> button corresponding to the desired Integrated DNS Provider inside the <label>DNS Zone Providers</label> card.

    ![Deleting a Zone from the DNS Zone Providers card](/files/dns-zone-providers-delete.png)

1.  Confirm the deletion of the zone from the Integrated DNS Provider by entering the name of the zone and clicking on the <label>Remove</label> button. The zone will be deleted from the Integrated DNS Provider, but will still be available at DNSimple.
