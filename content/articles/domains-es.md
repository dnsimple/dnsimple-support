This article explains the requirements and special procedures for .ES domain names.

## Registering a .ES domain {#registering}

### Legal form

You will need to select an entity type from the provided options. If you choose a non-individual type, the contact must include an organization.

### ID number

The ID card or passport number of the admin (you can create contacts for Spanish citizens using their passport. Choose **Others** from the dropdown as a type of identification document, and enter the passport number).

### ID type

Provide any of the following identification details:
- **DNI or NIF******: Select this option to provide either your Spanish National ID (DNI) or Spanish Tax Identification Number (NIF).
- **Resident alien ID (NIE)**: Select this option for foreigners in Spain, composed of a letter at the beginning, 7 numbers, and a final letter. Do not add any hyphens; only include letters and numbers.
- **Generic ID**: Select this option for passports, company registration numbers, and foreign documents.


## Transferring a .ES domain {#transferring}

### Required acknowledgment

All .ES domain transfers into DNSimple require your explicit acknowledgment before they can be completed.

After initiating the transfer, you will receive the acknowledgement email within the same day. Once acknowledgment is completed, your transfer will take up to a week to complete. There are no further steps needed after acknowledging the transfer.

<warning>
All unacknowledged transfers will be canceled after 14 days.
</warning>

#### Acknowledgment process

##### Check your email
An acknowledgment email will be sent to the domain registrant's email address <strong>(this may be different from your DNSimple account email)</strong>.

If you do not have access to the registrant's email address, we recommend updating this first via the domain's current registrar. Otherwise, your transfer won't succeed.

If you don't see the email, check your spam/junk folders.

##### Complete the process
Click the link provided in the acknowledgment email to confirm and complete your transfer.

If you don't receive the acknowledgement email, experience problems with the link, or need any help with your domain transfer, please [contact](https://dnsimple.com/contact) our support team.

## Renewing a .ES domain {#renewing}

### Auto-renewal only {#auto-renewal-required}

This TLD doesn't support manual renewals. To successfully renew the domain, the auto-renewal feature must be enabled, as explained in the [Domain Auto-Renewal article](/articles/domain-auto-renewal/#when-does-auto-renewal-happen/).

If auto-renewal is not enabled, the domain will be scheduled for removal **12 days before the expiration**. The registrar can deactivate it at any point during this period (even before the expiration date). You may be able to [restore](/articles/restoring-domain/) the domain before final deletion, but the registry will charge a redemption fee.

## Have more questions?

If you have any questions or need assistance registering domains with DNSimple, just [contact support](https://dnsimple.com/feedback), and we'll be happy to help.
