You can manage [AAAA records](/articles/aaaa-record/) in DNSimple using the [DNS record editor](/articles/record-editor/).

The instructions in this article assume you're familiar with the [AAAA record format](/articles/aaaa-record/#record-format) and usage.

## Adding an AAAA record

<div class="section-steps" markdown="1">
#### To add an AAAA record

1. Use the **account switcher** at the top right corner of the page to select the appropriate account.
1. From the **Domain Names** list, click the domain you want to manage.
1. On the domain page, click **DNS** at the top-right to open the **Record Editor**.

1. In the record editor, click <label>Add record</label> and select <label>AAAA</label> from the dropdown menu to add a new AAAA record.

      - **Name**: the subdomain you want to create the record for, without the domain name. For example, if you want to represent `www.example.com` enter `www`. Leave it blank to represent the root domain `example.com`.
      - **IP Address**: the IPv6 address the record will resolve to.
      - **TTL**: the record [time-to-live](/articles/what-is-ttl/).
      - **Respond From Regions**: Configure [Regional Records](/articles/regional-records/) if desired.
      - **Notes**: Optionally include a [record note](/articles/record-notes/).

1. Click <label>Add Record</label> to confirm and create the record.

The record is created and will be visible in the record list.

</div>

<note>
Some hosting providers label fields differently than DNSimple does, which can be confusing if you're copying DNS settings from another provider.
- In DNSimple, **Name** = what others might call _Host._
- In DNSimple, **Content** = what others might call _Value._
</note>
