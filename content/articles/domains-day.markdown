This article explains the requirements and special procedures for .DAY domain names.


## Registering a .DAY domain {#registering}

.day is a secured namespace, meaning that websites using a .day domain require an SSL certificate to work; .day websites can only be accessed by web browsers using HTTPS through an encrypted and secured connection.

You can obtain a certificate for your .day domain through DNSimple. To learn more, visit [SSL Certificates](/articles/ssl-certificates).

.day domain names that do not have an SSL certificate configured may still be used for email and other non-browser based uses.
