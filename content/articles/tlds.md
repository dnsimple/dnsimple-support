DNSimple supports registration and transfer for many top-level domains (TLDs), including generic TLDs (e.g., .COM, .NET), country-code TLDs (e.g., .UK, .CA, .IO), and new gTLDs. This guide points you to TLD basics and to per-TLD documentation for requirements, pricing, and transfer rules.

## TLD basics

Understand what TLDs are and which ones have special requirements:

- [What is a TLD?](/articles/what-is-tld/) - What a top-level domain is, how TLDs are grouped (gTLD, ccTLD, new gTLD), and where to see [TLDs supported by DNSimple](https://dnsimple.com/tlds).
- [Regulated Top-Level Domains](/articles/tlds-regulated/) - Requirements for regulated and highly-regulated TLDs (e.g., .BANK, .INSURANCE) and lists of which TLDs fall into each group.
