## Password reset link email

If a user with that email address exists, an email from support@dnsimple.com with a password reset link will be sent to that address.

If you have not received an email with a password reset link, make sure to check your Spam folder. If you have received the email, but the link isn't working, please [contact support](https://dnsimple.com/feedback).

## Enter a new password

On the password reset page, enter a new password. The new password will be recorded, and you'll be logged in.

## Troubleshooting

If you requested a password reset but have not received the email, follow these steps:

- **Verify your email**: Double-check that you entered the correct email address associated with your DNSimple account.
- **Alternative sign-in methods**: If your account is set up with Google or Okta single sign-on, use the corresponding method to log in instead of requesting a password reset.
- **Check your Spam folder**: Check if the password reset email was filtered into the Spam or Junk folder.
- **Account status**: If your domain or account is inactive, you might not receive reset emails. In this case, [reach out to our support team](https://dnsimple.com/feedback) for assistance.
