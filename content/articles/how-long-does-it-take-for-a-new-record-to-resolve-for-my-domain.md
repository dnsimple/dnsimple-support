# How Long Does It Take for a New Record to Resolve for My Domain?

If your account is active, records you add to a domain will be available within seconds from any of our name servers.

If your account is not yet active, records for your domains will be available once you activate your account.

If you query a name that's not yet in the system, some name servers may cache the negative response. It may take up to an hour for the negative result to be cleared from the name server cache and for the correct response to appear.
