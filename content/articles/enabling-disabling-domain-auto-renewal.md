# Enabling and Disabling Domain Auto-Renewal

Auto-renewal reduces the risk of a domain expiring by renewing the domain automatically days before expiration. When auto-renewal is turned on for a domain, we'll attempt to renew it automatically prior to expiration. We'll bill your credit card if the renewal is successful.

> [!NOTE]
> Most auto-renewals will begin a few days before a domain's expiration date. We deliver auto-renewal and expiration notices starting two months before a domain's expiration date, even if auto-renewal is turned on.

> [!WARNING]
> Refunds are not possible once the auto-renewal process has started.

## Enabling auto-renewal

You can enable auto-renewal when you first register a domain or any time after the domain has been registered.

Newly registered domains are set to auto-renew by default. If you turned off auto-renewal and want to re-enable it for your domain, follow these steps:

<div class="section-steps" markdown="1">
##### To enable auto-renewal for a domain

1. If you have more than one account, select the relevant one from the account switcher in the top-right corner of the screen.
1. On the header click the <label>Domain Names</label> tab. Click the relevant domain name to access the domain page.
1. In the **Overview** tab, check <label>Auto-renew this domain before it expires</label> on the **Registration status** card.
