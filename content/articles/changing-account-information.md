## Changing account email

<info>
If you want to update both your account and user email to the same address, you'll need to [update your user email](/articles/changing-email/#changing-the-user-email) first, then your account email.
</info>

You can update your account email address at any time. Changing your account email will **not** update your user email. To update your user email, follow [these instructions](/articles/changing-email/#changing-the-user-email).

<div class="section-steps" markdown="1">
1. Go to [your account page](https://dnsimple.com/account).
1. Click <label>Edit</label> at the bottom right of the <label>Account</label> card: 

    ![Settings menu](/files/account-menu.png)

1. Change the email, and click <label>Update account</label>.

    ![Email link](/files/account-email.png)

You'll be redirected to the Account page, where you'll see the updated email address displayed on the **Account** card. Please ensure the address is correct.
