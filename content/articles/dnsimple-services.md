# DNSimple Services

DNSimple provides essential services for every Internet-connected system:

- Domain registration, transfer, and renewal
- Hosted DNS
- A powerful automation API
- One-Click DNS services
- SSL certificates

If you manage domains across different services, our [Domain Control Plane](https://dnsimple.com/products/domain-control-plane) lets you connect your domains and DNS from various [DNS](/articles/integrated-dns-providers/) and [domain](/articles/integrated-domain-providers/) providers to manage all your domains through a single unified API and user interface.

## DNS hosting

Each DNS zone is billed separately from any base subscription fee. Pricing is available on our pricing page.

You can use DNSimple for Primary, [Secondary](/articles/secondary-dns/), and [Reverse](/articles/reverse-dns/) DNS.

### What is a DNS zone?

DNS zones can contain several [record types](/articles/common-dns-records/) for mapping domain names to IP addresses or other information. They distribute the workload associated with a domain to prevent overloading specific servers or administrators, give organizations better control over managing DNS records and traffic distribution, and accelerate data retrieval and routing.

## Domain registration, transfer, and renewal

We bill domain registrations and transfers on a yearly basis. Pricing varies depending on the TLD (Top-Level Domain). For more information, view our [TLD price list](https://dnsimple.com/tlds).

We also support [domain transfers](/articles/domain-transfer/) to and from DNSimple and offer domain [auto-renewal](/articles/domain-auto-renewal/).

Want to use our DNS hosting, but not registration? You have the option to use another registrar and [change your name servers to our name servers](/articles/delegating-dnsimple-hosted/). DNSimple customers aren't required to use our domain registration services to take advantage of our hosted DNS.

## Powerful automation API

With DNSimple's REST API, you can register domain names and administrate them directly from your own scripts. We have a repository [filled with API examples](https://github.com/dnsimple/dnsimple-api-examples), so you can get up and running.

Some things you can do with our API include:

- Check domain availability.
- Register and renew domains.
- Transfer domains.
- Buy SSL certificates.
- List and Manage Records.
- Register to events using [webhooks](https://dnsimple.com/webhooks) to receive notification of changes.
- [Query DNS analytics data](https://developer.dnsimple.com/v2/dns-analytics/).
