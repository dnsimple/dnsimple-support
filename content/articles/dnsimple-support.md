Scroll to the bottom of your DNSimple app and click 'Contact Us'.

You'll be sent to our contact page that has a fillable form. Complete that form to provide us with information to best help you with your question.

The contact page is also a great place to find our [support documentation](https://support.dnsimple.com), [developer documentation](https://developer.dnsimple.com) and [status page](https://dnsimple.statuspage.io).

## What should I include in my request?

Including the following information will help our support team answer your questions even faster:

- Send requests using the email associated with your account.
- Include the domain name(s) you're inquiring about.
- Include the full domain name when inquiring about a certificate.
- If you've received an error message, please share a screenshot of the error, and include the steps you took prior to receiving the error message.
- Share any relevant information, and let us know if you've followed the steps in the corresponding support documentation.

## What are your average response times?

Monday - Friday: We reply to all tickets within 24 hours.

Enterprise customers have the option to receive priority support with a dedicated queue and one-hour response times.

Response times may be slower on weekends or holidays. View our [Customer Support Policy](https://dnsimple.com/customer-support-policy) for more info.

## How do I get priority support?

Enterprise clients receive priority support and have a dedicated queue for faster responses. They are guaranteed to hear from us within an hour of receiving the initial request, provided the request is sent through their priority channel.

If you're an Enterprise customer and want to send a priority support email, fill out the contact form while logged in to your account.
