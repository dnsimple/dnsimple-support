This article explains the requirements and special procedures for .LI domain names.


## Renewing a .LI domain {#renewing}

### Auto-renewal only {#auto-renewal-required}

This TLD doesn't support manual renewals. To successfully renew the domain, the auto-renewal feature must be enabled, as explained in the [Domain Auto-Renewal article](/articles/domain-auto-renewal/#when-does-auto-renewal-happen/).

If auto-renewal is not enabled, the domain will be scheduled for removal **1 day before the expiration**. The registrar can deactivate it at any point during this period (even before the expiration date). You may be able to [restore](/articles/restoring-domain/) the domain before final deletion, but the registry will charge a redemption fee.
