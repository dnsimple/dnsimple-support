## Transferring a .MX domain {#transferring}

This article explains the specific requirements and behavior you should expect when transferring a .MX domain name to DNSimple.

.MX domains follow a registry-approved transfer process and do not complete immediately like most gTLD transfers. After the transfer is initiated, the current registrar must approve the request, so transfers can take up to 10 days to complete.
