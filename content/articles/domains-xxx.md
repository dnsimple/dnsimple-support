This article explains the requirements and special procedures for .XXX domain names.


## Registering a .XXX domain {#registering}

In order for a .XXX domain to be activated by the .XXX registry and be allowed to resolve, you must register on [the ICM Registry](http://icmregistry.com/about/sponsored-community/) and receive the required .XXX Member Auth Token to activate your domain. The .XXX TLD requires a Member Auth Token to be provided in order to activate the domain.

You can provide the token during the registration in the UI or as an extended attribute via API:

<strong>NOTE:</strong> Anyone can register non-resolving .XXX domains. Only individuals, business, entities, and organizations that:

- Provide online, sexually-oriented adult entertainment ("Online Adult Entertainment") intended for consenting adults or for other community members ("Providers")
- Represent Providers ("Representatives")
- Provide products or services to Providers and Representatives ("Service Providers")

are eligible to register .XXX domain names that can resolve. To register a domain that doesn't resolve, for instance to reserve it, setting the "Websites Resolve" option to "No" in the UI or via API.
