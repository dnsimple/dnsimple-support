[SupaDupa](http://supadupa.me) helps you set up your own professional online store without any of the skills or upfront commitments required when hiring a web agency to build one for you. With DNSimple one-click [DNS services](/categories/services/) you can set up the DNS records required by SupaDupa using the one-click service we provide.


## Enabling SupaDupa service

From the domain list, click on the domain name you want to update and then click on the DNS tab. Then scroll down to locate the One Click Services section, and select "Manage services".

Now the service is added. You can remove it any time by following the steps on [how to remove a service](/articles/services/#removing-services).

Activating this service will configure DNS records where your main domain is your store. You must also [configure a URL redirect](/articles/redirector/) pointing `example.com` to `www.example.com` (replace `example.com` with your real domain name).
