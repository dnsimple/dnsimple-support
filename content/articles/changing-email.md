## A note about accounts

When you initially sign up as a user in our system, we create an account bound to that user. We call this the Primary Account, and the email address is the same as the username. If you change the email address for that user, the account email address will also be updated. That way customers with a single account only have to update their email in one place. Follow the instructions in [Changing User Email](#changing-the-user-email) if this is the case for you.

Extra accounts have their own email addresses that can be changed ad-hoc.

<warning>
System limitations do not currently allow Primary Accounts to be deleted.

## Changing the account email

<div class="section-steps" markdown="1">
1. Go to [your account page](https://dnsimple.com/account).
1. On the account name section, click the <label>Edit</label> link:

1. Change the email and press <label>Update Account</label>.

    ![Email link](/files/account-email.png)

</div>

<info>
If the <label>Account email</label> input field is missing under <label>Edit account</label>, then this is the Primary account attached to your user. You'll need to [update your user email to change this address](#changing-the-user-email).

You can change the email associated with your user profile from the DNSimple account page.

## Changing the user email
