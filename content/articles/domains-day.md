This article explains the requirements and special procedures for .DAY domain names.


## Registering a .DAY domain {#registering}

.DAY is a secured namespace, meaning that websites using a .DAY domain require an SSL certificate to work; .DAY websites can only be accessed by web browsers using HTTPS through an encrypted and secured connection.

You can [obtain a certificate for your .DAY domain](https://dnsimple.com/ssl-certificates) through DNSimple. To learn more, visit [SSL Certificates](/articles/ssl-certificates).

.DAY domain names that do not have an SSL certificate configured may still be used for email and other non-browser based uses.
