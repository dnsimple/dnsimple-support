# Managing Integrated Domains

From the Domains page, you can view the refreshed state of your DNSimple domains alongside domains from [Integrated Domain Providers](/articles/integrated-domain-providers/).

<div class="section-steps" markdown="1">
##### Viewing integrated domains from the Domains page

1.  Log in to DNSimple with your user credentials.
1.  Select the relevant account.
1.  On the header, click the <label>Domain Names</label> tab.
1.  On the Domain Names page, you can browse your integrated domains alongside DNSimple domains. Integrated domains are marked by a label under the "Domain Registration" column. For example, domains imported from GoDaddy would have a "GoDaddy" label under the "Domain Registration". You can click on any domain in the list to visit its manage page.

Loading the Domain Names page automatically refreshes the current state of integrated domains and imports any new domains from linked Integrated Domain Providers.

DNSSEC information for an integrated domain can be retrieved by clicking **DNSSEC** on the sidebar. There, you can see if DNSSEC is enabled for the domain.
