This guide explains the requirements and process for registering a .JOBS domain through DNSimple.

## Registering a .JOBS domain

When registering a .JOBS domain, you will need to provide the following information:
- **Registrant information**: Your contact details.
- **Company URL**: Your official company website or homepage.
- **Industry**: The industry your business operates in.

### Registry review
- Once the registration has been submitted, your application will be forwarded to the.JOBS registry for review.
- The domain status will be marked as "pending" during this process.

<info>
Applications for .JOBS domains that match a company name, brand name, or product name are typically approved on the same business day. Ensure that the verification URL provided during registration (such as your company's homepage) is accurate, as it plays a critical role in the registry's review process.

## Approval or additional information

### Approval
If approved, your .JOBS domain will be registered and activated.

### If additional information is required
If the registry cannot verify your connection to the domain, they may request additional documentation.

- DNSimple will notify you with instructions on how to proceed.
- **How to submit documents:**
    - Email your documents directly to **support@goto.jobs**.
    - Include the domain name you are registering in the email subject line.

## Important notes

- **Generic names**: If you're registering a generic name (not a company name, brand name, or product name from your business), **contact the .JOBS registry directly using their online submission form** before applying via DNSimple. 
- **Pending status**: Applications can remain in "pending" status for up to 30 days. After this period, unapproved applications are automatically removed.
