# What Is WHOIS?

WHOIS (pronounced "who is") is a protocol and database system that provides public access to information about domain name registrations. When you register a domain name, certain information about the registration is stored in a WHOIS database and made publicly accessible to anyone who queries it.

## What is WHOIS used for?

WHOIS serves several important purposes in the domain name system. It provides transparency and accountability by identifying who owns or is responsible for a domain name. WHOIS contains contact details for domain registrants, which can be used for legitimate purposes such as resolving technical issues, reporting abuse, or handling legal matters. WHOIS information also helps verify domain ownership and facilitates domain transfers and other administrative processes. Technical contact information in WHOIS can help network administrators resolve connectivity or configuration issues.

## What information is in WHOIS?

WHOIS records contain information about a domain registration. This includes registrant information with the name and contact details of the person or organization that registered the domain. Administrative contact information identifies the person or organization responsible for administrative decisions about the domain. Technical contact information identifies the person or organization responsible for technical aspects of the domain. WHOIS also includes registrar information showing which domain registrar registered the domain, registration dates indicating when the domain was first registered and when it expires, name servers that are authoritative for the domain, and domain status showing the current status of the domain such as active, locked, or pending transfer.

## How does WHOIS work?

WHOIS operates through a distributed database system. When you register a domain, your registrar collects contact information and submits it to the registry for the top-level domain (TLD). The registry stores this information in a WHOIS database. Anyone can query the WHOIS database using WHOIS lookup tools or command-line utilities to retrieve domain registration information. The WHOIS system returns the publicly available information about the domain.

## WHOIS and privacy

Because WHOIS information is publicly accessible, privacy concerns have led to the development of privacy protection services. Many registrars, including DNSimple, offer WHOIS privacy services that replace your personal contact information with proxy contact details in the public WHOIS database. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has also led to changes in how WHOIS data is displayed for many TLDs, with some information being redacted or hidden by default.

## WHOIS and domain management

WHOIS information plays an important role in domain management. WHOIS contains the contact information for domain registrants, administrative contacts, and technical contacts. WHOIS contact information is used to verify domain ownership and send transfer authorization emails during domain transfers. When you update domain contact information, the changes are reflected in the WHOIS database. Some registries use WHOIS email addresses for domain validation, though this practice is being phased out in favor of more secure validation methods.
