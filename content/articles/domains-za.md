This article explains the requirements and special procedures for .ZA domain names.

## Transferring a .ZA domain to DNSimple {#transferring}

### Before you start

<warning>
As with any domain transfer, to avoid the possibility of downtime you should [point the name servers for the domain to DNSimple (or another provider) before you begin the transfer](/articles/before-transferring-domain/). This will prevent downtime and will also allow you to perform changes to the DNS records during the domain transfer.
</warning>

### Required acknowledgment

All `.ZA` domain transfers into DNSimple require your explicit acknowledgment before they can be completed.

After initiating the transfer, you will receive the acknowledgement email within the same day. Once acknowledgment is completed, your transfer will take up to a week to complete. There are no further steps needed after acknowledging the transfer.

<warning>
All unacknowledged transfers will be canceled after 14 days.
</warning>

#### Acknowledgment process

##### Check your email
An acknowledgment email will be sent to the domain registrant's email address <strong>(this may be different from your DNSimple account email)</strong>.

If you do not have access to the registrant's email address, we recommend updating this first via the domain's current registrar. Otherwise, your transfer won't succeed.

If you don't see the email, check your spam/junk folders.

If you have any questions, [contact us](https://dnsimple.com/contact), and we'll help you register the domain.
