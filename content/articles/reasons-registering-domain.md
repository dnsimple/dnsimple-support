# Why Should I Register My Domain Name with DNSimple?

Domain registration with DNSimple is as easy as it gets. And there's no complicated pricing or convoluted contracts.

We currently don't offer domain registration as a stand-alone service. Since [domain services](/articles/dnsimple-services) are our core business, DNSimple registration requires a [subscription](https://dnsimple.com/pricing). DNSimple customers are not required to use our domain registration services to take advantage of our hosted DNS.

We make [domain registration](/articles/registering-domain/) effortless, and offer [over 500 TLDs](https://dnsimple.com/tlds).

We also keep things straightforward. All domains registered with DNSimple automatically use DNSimple's name servers and [hosted DNS](https://dnsimple.com/products/dns-hosting). And we'll never sell you anything you don't need.
