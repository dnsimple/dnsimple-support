# Why should I register my domain name with DNSimple?

Domain registration with DNSimple is as easy as it gets. And there's no complicated pricing or convoluted contracts.

We make domain registration effortless:

- Enter a name and verify it's available.
- Select a registrant from your contacts or add a new contact.
- For domains that require extended attributes (like `.CA` and `.US`), fill in the required fields.
- Register the domain.

We keep things straightforward. All domains registered with DNSimple automatically use DNSimple's name servers and hosted DNS. And we'll never sell you anything you don't need. 


<info>
We currently don't offer domain registration as a stand-alone service. Since [domain services](/articles/dnsimple-services) are our core business, DNSimple registration requires a subscription. DNSimple customers aren't required to use our domain registration services to take advantage of our hosted DNS.
