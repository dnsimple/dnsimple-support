# Contributing to DNSimple Support

Follow these guidelines when creating or editing support articles and category config. Full source: [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) / [GitHub](https://github.com/dnsimple/dnsimple-support/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Creating and Reviewing Articles

- Create a branch, follow writing guidelines, include relevant links, test with `rake run`, then open a PR.
- PR process: label `documentation`, set assignee, request reviews (expert + Alyse for proofreading + Customer Success for substantial updates). Test at https://sandbox.dnsimple.com. Merge yourself and delete source branch.

## Content Writing Guidelines

### APA Style and Diataxis

- **APA Style:** [APA Style Guidelines](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/). Conform to APA for style, grammar, citations, headings, and structure in `content/articles/`.
- **Diataxis:** [Diataxis Framework](https://diataxis.fr/). Article type must match user intent (Getting Started, Tutorial, How-to Guide, Explanation, Reference). Scope and structure must align with that type.

### Writing and Markdown

- Be clear and concise. Each step clearly communicated or linked. Minimize scrolling.
- Use GitHub-Flavored Markdown (GFM). DNSimple style guide for technical writing.

### Callouts (GFM)

- `[!NOTE]` – User should be aware; not damaging to account.
- `[!TIP]` – Helpful recommendations; non-critical.
- `[!WARNING]` – Critical; user could do something damaging or permanent.

Syntax: blockquote with `> [!NOTE]` (or TIP/WARNING) on first line, then `> content` lines. Use sparingly; place near relevant content.

### List Formatting

Always put a newline between a colon and list items:

```markdown
This is a title:

- List item
```

Not: `This is a title:\n- List item`

### Links

- Internal article links: support.dnsimple.com
- Product/marketing: dnsimple.com
- Keep links current; add external explanation links where helpful.

### SEO and Frontmatter

- Strongest keywords in H1/H2; no keyword stuffing.
- Every article: `excerpt` and `meta` frontmatter. Optional `social` for og:image (images in `images/social`).

## Managing Content

- **Categories:** Edit `priorities/categories.yaml`; then `rake run`.
- **Sub-categories:** Edit YAML in `categories/`. Align with Diataxis types (Getting Started, Explanation, How-to Guide, Reference, Tutorial). Unlisted articles go to "Other". Then `rake run`.

## Git and Testing

- Commits: clear, descriptive, imperative mood (e.g. "Add article about...", "Update DNS guide..."). One logical change per commit.
- Before submitting: `rake run`. Check pages render, links work, no build errors, content at http://localhost:3000.
